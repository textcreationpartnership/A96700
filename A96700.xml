            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

My Lords, he that hath the Spirit and Blood of his Anceſtours in his veins, cannot be ſo much turned into a Statue as to ſtand ſtill and admire the different Fortunes, this mans

The clear Fountain flowing from the true Nobility of late being ſo diſturbed, it is the office of an honeſt and true Hiſtorian, if not his duty, to have ſo much of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, as to Regiſter the Deſcents, Iſſues, worthy Acts, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, Mannagements of our of late ſo little imitated Anceſtors; of theſe ſeveral alterations in Nobility one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, there are three principle Actors on the Theater of great Families; the Beginner, Advancer, and Ruiner; in all theſe our uncivil troubleſome times we have heard more of the latter then of the other two; one experiencſt though unfortunate good, amongſt the many miſchiefs, which a Civil War occaſions, is that in the ranſacking of Studies, accidentally, though determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned otherwiſe, the <hi>Togati</hi> and the <hi>Armati</hi> meet; ſeveral Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts which otherwiſe would have remained uſeful only to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, have been by Divine Providence miraculouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, contrary to the intentions of the Agents, whoſe Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes had ſnuft out the candle to the preſent Age, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved poſterity of thoſe Illuſtrations from which they might know that truth, which otherwiſe they ſhould never have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: as they endeavoured that the moſt remarkable Affairs of theſe times ſhould have otherwiſe been hid under a buſhel.

My Lord, I know to your Honour it is no leſs then a Prodigy that our Engliſh Gentlemen ſhould be more exact and refin'd

My Lords, I have choſen you as out of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> to affix your names to this Epitome of Lives, that as <hi>Julius</hi> was his own Hiſtory and Commentary, ſo your Honours though yet but in the abſtract of time, might paſs it to poſterity; to which purpoſe, I have choſen your united protections. Since I have been writing this Hiſtory, there hath been no leſs then three alterations, Regal, Protector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and now a Commonwealth; I firſt undertook this enterprize in the time of Monarchy, continued it in the ſhort ſpace of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorſhip, and finiſhed it in the immediate initiation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: in all which progreſſions, if the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects modeſt proſpects are ſhut up, or not allow'd, if in theſe days that Lots little one of truth, by theſe preſent times poſterity muſt be deprived of, wiſe and honeſt men will be ſeriouſly ſenſible of ſuch obſtructions; the maliciouſneſs of ſuch Machiavillians puts me in mind of what elegant Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> cites what Naturaliſts obſerve of the Toad, who before ſhe can be ſurprized by death, ſucks up the ſuppoſed precious ſtone in her head, which till then was but a jelly; thus ſome men are ſo cowardly that they had rather have Hiſtory buried with them, then that the leaſt part of civil truth ſhould be writ whileſt they live, as if they deſerved no Chronicle, or were only to be ſuffered in Libellous Pamphlets, which wiſe men ſcorn to caſt their eyes on. I confeſs we live in times of Jealouſies, nevertheleſs there is no danger in a Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that drives on a harmleſs deſign, which for the Innocency of it, craves protection from ſuch tender years. My Lords, I
<pb facs="tcp:116025:4"/>wiſh that your Families may ever flouriſh, whoſe Charities like the expected ſhowres have refreſht our parched Engliſh Earth, being nevertheleſs ſo undeſcernable as the winde, the left hand not knowing what the right hand did; the ſo eminent Nobleſſes of your Generous Blood hath obliged our Engliſh world, and amongſt the reſt of my Countrey-men, commanded me to preſent theſe humble reſpects to your Lordſhips. In the tender of theſe Lives, My Lords, I have turned the Mirror of them to you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that by your future Atchievements you will get up hill to theſe Worthies, not queſtioning but ſome other Pen when I am in my ſilent grave will raiſe Pyramids to your Names, and affix you to this Volume: If your Lordſhips in your inſpect at my turning of this Mirror to you, ſtill perceive ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of a ſad repreſentation, a once ſable mourning cloud, 'tis now ſo ſerene, ſo diſperſed with the Beams and Splendors of Honour, that you may ſafely be ſo loyal to Heaven, as with a correlative gratitude, to acknowledge the remarks of that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe.

Be pleaſed to accept of theſe tenders of Service, as alſo of my beſt wiſhes, that as you have met in your Affinities, ſo joynt Vertues may be united in your Natures, which ſhall be his requeſt to Heaven, who is the meaneſt and unworthieſt of</p>

            <p>IT may make you the more to admire at my boldneſs, that in a midnight as not known to you, I ſhall nevertheleſs preſent theſe more then ordinary reſpects; I acknowledge till the <hi>Magi</hi> of thoſe that rightly knew you had crown'd my tenders with the Laurels of your deſerts, I had not laid down this Dedication otherwiſe, then at the feet of your Eminent Qualifications, as of a proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to what ſtill remains of the ſurviving Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Sir, I have plac'd you in the Front of my He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe's, not diſputing after ſo confirm'd a ſurvey of you by your Friends, that I could not chuſe a more fortunate Star to direct theſe my ſervices, then to your ſelf; as I am informed with your own Pen you have begun with the life of <hi>Adam,</hi> the creation of Hiſtory, give me leave after your Italian Victory, to entertain you with theſe Brittiſh Triumphs, which take their riſe from the Chriſtian Croſs of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and ſit down within the Herodian ſhort-liv'd Protectorſhips. Sir, as to the undertakings of Hiſtory, you are not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted that Judgement and a ſignaliz'd Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
<pb facs="tcp:116025:5"/>eternizes an Hiſtorian. That oyl is adjudged the beſt that hath no taſte; that Authour ſhould be the moſt preferr'd that hath the leaſt tongue of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted affections, a candour of courſe being due to him that waves the chiding of the preſent times, in hopes that after Ages may excuſe him. Seamen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the waters are the more troubled the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they come to the Land, becauſe broken by reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion from the ſhore; I am ſenſible (though that I cannot imagine wherefore) of the ſame danger, the nearer I approach to the times, and the end of this Hiſtory, the more ſubject ſome will be to cenſure what they have ſo little wit as to interpret to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. One writes, if he did not invent the words himſelf, that <hi>Machiavel</hi> uſed to ſay, that he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to write a Hiſtory ſhould have no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if ſo (ſayes he) gloſſing on his own wit, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi> himſelf was the beſt qualified in his age to be an Hiſtorian; the Gentleman is much miſtaken, alas he was but a ſimple fellow to the Religious Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites of our times, as he wanted the Holy Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Vizards of Scripture to gild over his deſigns. Some entertain this poſition, that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of theſe preſent times muſt not be written by any one alive, which in my opinion is diſgraceful to an Hiſtorian, and very prejudicial to poſterity; as if they were to write at a diſtance, that obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might protect their miſtakes from diſcovery: others alſo ſay, the Truth is not ripe enough to be writ in the Age we live in, which proves too rotten
<pb facs="tcp:116025:5"/>for the next generation faithfully to report: theſe men are extreamly miſtaken, for when Impreſſes of memorable matters are almoſt worn out, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory having more of the Authors hand then foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of truth therein, muſt needs ſuffer; ſure I am that the moſt informative Hiſtories to poſterity, and ſuch as are highly priz'd by the Judicious, have been written by eye-witneſſes; ſuch Hiſtorians as live in the Times, not by the Times; thus <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides</hi> reports impartially of the Pelopeneſian War. Indeed St. <hi>Peter</hi> followed Chriſt afar off, ſo Politicians would not have the Hiſtorian to tread on the heels of the times, leſt the times tread on his heels; the truth is, we live in ſuch a warlike tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Age, beſt to write of, but not to write in. Sir, if Wit be ſuch a Plant that it ſcarce receives heat enough to keep it alive in the Summer of our cold Climate, how can it chuſe but wither in the ſo long and ſharp a Winter of our Civil Uncivil Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. If my endeavors meet with any acceptation in this our Engliſh world, it muſt be from ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Perſons as your ſelf, as it will remain a perpetual memorial to your name, as firſt brought forth under the Sphere of your tuition and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Worthy Sir, together with the reſpects I tender to your honoured ſelf, I have entertained it as a Caſe of Conſcience to tranſmit to the next Age ſome ſhort Intimations of theſe times, as any wiſe Hiſtorian may juſtly fear that Records are not ſo carefully kept in theſe ſo many changes, as they
<pb facs="tcp:116025:6"/>have been in former Ages; as to the breviary of theſe Lives, I can only apologize, that no wiſe man can expect to cut and polliſh Diamonds with ſo little pains as we do Marbles; the chiefeſt matters contained in Gyant-like Volumes is to be found in this, like a little Watch ſhowing the time of the day as well as a great Clock. Sir, leſt having written a Preface in reſpect of theſe tedious Lines, you ſhould miſtake them for another, I ſhall end with this ſhort ejaculation, that as Fortune, whom the Poets have ſo long feign'd blinde, hath opened her eyes to look upon you as to your deſires and deſerts, ſo I wiſh you may enjoy her favours as many more happy Years as there are Lives in this Book.

            <p>THere is no treaſure ſo much enriches the minde of man as Learning; there is no Learning ſo proper for the direction of the life of man as Hiſtory; no Hiſtory that carries more weight of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with it, then that of our own Countrey: In the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of which great enterprize, not a word that the Hiſtorian writes but ſhould be laden with the truth of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſayes of <hi>Galba,</hi> it ought to be <hi>Imperatoria brevitate.</hi> It hath been critically obſerved by ſome, that moſt Hiſtorians ſpeak too much, and ſay too little; I doubt others will think, I ſpeak too little, and ſay too much, ſo that it will be difficult to pleaſe all. My Method ſhall be, firſt to diſcourſe of Hiſtory it ſelf; next of the rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that are to be obſerved in the ſtudy of it; then of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitomies what they are, the admirable uſe that may be made of them ſeveral wayes, more reſpectively as to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Lives of Perſons; afterwards of the uſe, benefit, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that accrew by the reading of it; concluding with ſome other Addreſſes as to the right underſtanding of this now at laſt publiſht Work. <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> writes, <hi>makes us acquainted with our dead Anceſtours, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering us their memory and fame; out of it we gather a policy, no leſs otherwiſe then eternal, by the compariſon and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other mens forepaſt miſeries with our own like errours and ill deſervirgs.</hi> Hiſtory, as it were, thus ſhooting off a warning-piece, from which we have the dear bought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb facs="tcp:116025:7"/>of former and of latter times; that in an hour we know what our Predeceſſours were many years attaining to: It makes a young man to be ancient without wrinkles or gray hairs, principling him with the experiences, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and inconveniences of old age. Thus we clearly perceive how Empires, Kingdoms, and Commonwealths every where have had their periods, but the Hiſtory of them remains and lives for the inſtructions of men, and the glory of God, the chief intent and uſe of this ſtudy being to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our Creatour, who onely is unchangeable, and to admire his Wiſdom and Providence in humane miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. 'Tis undeniable that it hath pleaſed the Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all things to preſerve the Arts of reading of men to himſelf, yet as the fruits tell the name of the tree, ſo do the outward works of men ſo far as their agitations are acted, give us to gueſs at the reſt; no man can lay continual maſques, ſo counterfeit behaviours, the things that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for pretences having no ground of truth, cannot long diſſemble their own nature, ſo irreſiſtable is the force of truth, the Divine Providence ſo powerful, that howſoever the greateſt diligence hath been uſed to carry all in ſecret, to act with colourable evaſions and gloſſes, like Tumblers that are ſquint-eyed, looking one way, and aiming another, yet in theſe our days, we have known the cloſeſt of State ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets brought to light, the cunningeſt conſultations and contrivances diſcovered; thus we have ſeen wicked Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſeldom happy by their baſeneſs, often loſing all which either their ſubtleties, fortune, or other mens labours had caſt upon them; and if they retain their ambitions for a life, <hi>non gaudet tertius Haeres.</hi> To this purpoſe one writes excellently, <hi>Hiſtory is the mirrour for us to look in, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to us things paſt as if they were preſent, and enables us to make a rational conjecture of things to come.</hi> For this world affordeth no new accidents, but in the ſame ſenſe wherein we call a <hi>New Moon,</hi> which is the old one in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb facs="tcp:116025:7"/>ſhape, and yet no other then what hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; old actions return again furbuſht over with ſome new and different circumſtances. The Premiſes conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to all wiſe men Hiſtory muſt bear up, be highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, onely what Pilot in ſo vaſte a Sea is able to ſteer aright, except he have diſcovered thoſe Rocks on which others have ſplit, ſo as to have firſt rightly poiſed their errours; he that is not ſufficiently knowing of the ſlips of ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and the trips that Writers cunningly give one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, will never be ſo wiſe as to ſet up for himſelf. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in theſe laſt inſtances I have digreſſed, as I would as it were <hi>praeire,</hi> before I arrived at my directions for the reading of Hiſtory; to prepare the Student in the purſuit of which Subject onely, I ſhall throughout the whole thred of them interweave ſome unworthy Obſervations of my own; yet ſo as for the main, endeavour to keep cloſe to the ſcope and ſenſe of a late learned Authour, whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Manuſcripts I could wiſh for the future good of poſterity were committed to the Preſs. The firſt thing that is to be undertaken in this Enterprize, is to attain to ſome skill both in Ancient and Modern Geography, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Hiſtory is nothing but a Chaos of improbable and indigeſted tales, as Geography without Hiſtory is a blank paper; then to betake ones ſelf to ſome little Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, not forgetting to ſhred it into an exact Chronology, for the ſeries of the Hiſtory, which will both help the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the memory, it being as it were the fractions of time. Read <hi>Herodians</hi> Lives of the Emperours, <hi>Juſtin,</hi> which is a general <hi>Compendium</hi> of all; then <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Lives, an exact Syſtome of the Greek and Roman Affairs, which of all Nations were ſeaſon'd with the greateſt wiſdom; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract Political Obſervations, without which Hiſtory is little worth, and Fables were as good as Hiſtories; yet under the veil of Fables lies hid all the Divinity and Philoſophy of the wiſe Ancients. That common fault of reading for
<pb facs="tcp:116025:8"/>pleaſure, as the idle people do to paſs away the time, is to be avoided; this at the beſt is but a ſupine labour. Be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to collect from variety of events experience and civil wiſdom, by obſerving both Moral and Political Actions; the parties, the cauſes, the ſtate of them, and parallel them with others of the like nature, for it may prove ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to one, and vice to another; the doing of an action, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in one, &amp; madneſs in another, and ſo continually fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or unfortunate; which might be made good by ſeveral examples, which for brevity I ſhall omit. Here alſo the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian amongſt other difficulties will meet with theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom curioſities, and more then niceties, as they are too uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally miſtakes; as touching ſums of money, numbers of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Ships, the ſlain in Battle, computation of Time, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Names, Titles, &amp;c. wherein Authours agree not; and it were to be wiſhed that the aſſured Notes of ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars were to be had. Theſe things I inſert onely as cautions. To proceed, the Student having firſt in his reading gained forth his remarks, and gleaned his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into heads, he is next to commit them to paper; for though the memory be the treaſure of knowledge, yet we muſt not truſt it too much, we ſo often finding our accounts fall ſhort; therefore the Student ſhould be ſure to rank his obſervations with all poſſible order, otherwiſe they will be troubleſome and leſs profitable. The Authority of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour is ſeriouſly to be regarded, it being the Baſis of the whole building; therefore before reading, the beſt infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ought to be had how he is eſteemed, whether ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of faith or no, whether diſintereſted in the buſineſs he treats of, whether a Native or a Forreigner; theſe latter groſly miſtaking, as <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> doth too often in our Hiſtory. <hi>Philip Comines</hi> commonly mentions thoſe from whom he had his relations, it being the way whereby credit is extreamly courted, learned men having had a great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his writings. In the next place thoſe Authors are
<pb facs="tcp:116025:8"/>to be compared with others of the ſame ſubject, that ſo if it may be poſſible to reconcile their differences, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to thoſe that bring the moſt colourable reaſons or beſt authority, this will give you a great light to reading, and be an extraordinary help to your judgement and memory; and take it for a general Cannon, never to read a Tranſlation if you can underſtand and procure the Original: tranſlated Books being like removed Plants, degenerating from their excellency and native worth, becauſe Tranſlators though able, and furniſht with the advantages of language, are never able to attain to the Authors own genious: to them joyn the choyceſt Commentators, that handle the cuſtoms, whether Tacticks or Stratagemicks, few Claſſick Authors having not ſome, if not all; the underſtanding of either of theſe will mightily augment the life of a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>'Tis now high time to deſcend to ſome particular dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; as for the election of ſome Authors, begin with the ſhorteſt, I have already occaſionally cited <hi>Juſtin;</hi> I ſhall now amongſt the Romans begin with <hi>Lucius Florus,</hi> an elegant writer, though ſomewhat too panegerical: read <hi>Veleius Paterculus,</hi> an excellent Author, who beſides the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his ſtile, ſlices the time with a diligent calculation, who moſt accurately Annatomizes the mindes of thoſe great perſons who were the chief Authors of thoſe Affairs he treats of. Then you may give eſſayes to <hi>Livy,</hi> and <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Dionyſſus Halicarnaſſus,</hi> &amp;c. For the Emperours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Tacitus</hi> rather then <hi>Suetonius,</hi> both becauſe he is not ſo confuſed, as for the excellent Theorems of his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which he hath almoſt in every line, but alas his rents witneſs in him the wounds of Barbariſme; but to remedy that, procure in them what you can to ſuccenturiate in the Hiſtory diligently, as I have already adviſed take the thred of time for conduct through the laborynth; then ſet your minde to obſerve the cuſtoms and alterations: there
<pb facs="tcp:116025:9"/>are ſome things (not to inſtance them they are ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known) that were in the free State of <hi>Rome</hi> that were not in the Empire; and on the contrary, that in the latter which was not in the former; look alſo into the manners of the people whoſe gheſts you read, and pry as much as you can into the ſecret humours of the Governours, the inclinations of the people, how when wantonning with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, how when feeling the pinches of fortune; obſerving alſo what nature they borrow from their climes, the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern being more fruitful, the Southern more ſubtil, of whom nevertheleſs the others have gained ground, as the Gothes of the Romans, the Engliſh of the French; as alſo that mountainous people are ever more hardy then thoſe of the Plains, Husbandmen then Citizens: for the former the Switz may exemplifie, without whoſe Infantry the French who are excellent Horſe-men dare hardly take the Field; for the other, the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> (in whoſe admiration I can never ſatisfie my ſelf,) giving the reaſon why we breed ſo good Foot, ſayes, it is becauſe it depends on the yeomanry, the great joyſts of a ſtate as well in peace as in War, ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath infuſed into every Nation ſome particular condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the Romans deſire of Glory and Sovereignty, and a great obſervation of their promiſes. The Spaniards are reſervedly proud, zealous of the honour of their Countrey. The French in the beginning of a Battel more then men, in the proſecution leſs then women, hot, fiery, and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſpirits, &amp;c. So <hi>Herodian</hi> obſerves the Antiochians, apt to any change. <hi>Comines,</hi> the people of <hi>Gaunt</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> loving their Lords before they come into the Government, and then having them, inconſtant, ſeditious, &amp;c. theſe things will ſpeak themſelves, and are commonly the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the whole Nation epitomized.</p>
            <p>To be brief, Hiſtory hath this preheminency above Oratory and Poetry, that Oratory hath been rejected by the Lacedemonians; Poetry by <hi>Plato, Tertullian,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb facs="tcp:116025:9"/>as two pernicious inſtruments in a Commonwealth, to pervert mens mindes; but Hiſtory was never yet reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any; for what can be more profitable then to learn wiſdom by other mens follies, to get experience by other mens coſt and labours, and to be ſafe by other mens dangers. Hiſtory is like a watch-tower, on which we may ſee dangers afar off, and ſo avoid them; and what can be more pleaſant then to ſee a Tragedy acted to the life, which onely is to be ſeen in Hiſtory; for here we ſhall ſee the whole world, but as a Stage on which men of all ſorts have acted their parts, Princes, Prelates, Peaſants of all ages acting the ſame things, on the ſame Stage; who after they have laid aſide their diſcriminating Vizards, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonating Garments, they are all alike, as they were before they put them on: for Kings and Beggars have the ſame way of coming in, and the ſame way of going out; <hi>Mors Sceptra ligonibus aequat: Diogenes</hi> cannot diſtinguiſh King <hi>Philips</hi> Skull from the reſt; nor is there any difference in <hi>Charons</hi> boat, between the greateſt and the meaneſt, all muſt row there alike.</p>
            <p>As for my other conſideration of Epitomies, what they are, I acknowledge them to be but lively Landskips, ſuch as if naturally drawn, are <hi>ex pede Herculem,</hi> not to reflect on thoſe common ſaws, <hi>Homers Iliads in a Nut-ſhell,</hi> that <hi>life is ſhort, and art is long;</hi> nor to retort at the prolixity and dulneſs of ſome Hiſtorians, ſome of which like <hi>Tom. Coriat</hi> memorize where they laſt urined; to inſtance one for all, <hi>Hollingſhead,</hi> who diſcourſes of tempeſts, of lightnings, of thunders, and trifling paſſages, as the burning of Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Houſes, &amp;c. of whom that learned Hiſtorian of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> writes thus, <hi>Volumnious</hi> Hollingſhead <hi>and</hi> Stow, <hi>full of confuſion and commixture of unworthy rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Without queſtion a great part of the perfection of a Hiſtorian conſiſts in the wiſdom of epitomizing, in picking out the morrow of larger Hiſtories, they being ſo often
<pb facs="tcp:116025:10"/>fraught with impertinencies, ſaucy cenſures, and too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial adorations; to read large Volumes young men in the heat of their youthful diverſions will not condeſcend, and Princes have not the leiſure. <hi>Virgil</hi> (if we may reflect on Tradition,) after he had written thirty verſes in a morning, ſpent the reſt of the day to convert them into three good ones; like <hi>Ben. Johnſon,</hi> who to one that told him of his oyl and his lamp, the pains he took before his Births, thoſe happy abſtracts of the humours and manners of men; gave this anſwer, <hi>That his were Works, the other printed things for the Stage were but Playes.</hi> Dons <hi>and</hi> Cleavelands <hi>Poems, how have they whipt and pedantized the other locuſts of Poetry?</hi> thus a true Diamond is to be eſteemed above heaps of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi> ſtones. To inſtance further, as to the writing of Lives, Hiſtorians that are thus employed, are, or ought to be the moſt impartial of all other Authors, except by their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and flatteries they have reſolved to render themſelves worſe then Pimps to poſterity; it being their determined employment and proper duties to pull off the perriwigs and diſguiſes of great men, and to preſent them in their own colours, as a mans exterior actions are the beſt indicia of his minde; ſome men in their publick actions being meer mimicks, whereas in private they put off their aſſumed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and become themſelves again. A diſinterreſſed Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, for what next to God he can diſcover, paints them to the life; the general complaint in this particular is of the ſcarcity of the writers of lives: Indeed I know but few of the modern have laboured this way, for antiquity we have <hi>Laertius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> you may happily pardon me if I touch at either of them, there is a certain abundance of moral wiſdom in <hi>Laertius,</hi> he is rich in his examples of ancient Sages, is fraught almoſt in every page with moral inſtructions. <hi>Plutarchs</hi> fortune is to have engaged with warlike ſpirits, yet you may finde in him counſels as well for the Gown as the Sword. I conceive no reaſon why
<pb facs="tcp:116025:10"/>
               <hi>Bodin</hi> and ſome others ſhould bark at him, and ſay, his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory may well be called Parallels, for they never meet; truly conſidering their internal inclinations, by their leave, in my judgement they are admirably well ſuited, nay, moſt of their actions concur; now if one had not the ſame fortune, as another Countrey roſe when the other fell, it makes nothing againſt him, ſince chance may help the weak to the Victory.</p>
            <p>But leſt contrary to my own Intention I ſhould enlarge my ſelf too much, it will now be high time for me to fall on my next particular, what is the uſe, benefit, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that accrew from the reading of Hiſtory. From this Study we learn the cauſes, riſes, alterations, revolutions, characters of divers perſons, the mutability of Councels, the remarkableneſſe of actions, the ſubtleties of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the drifts of intereſts, the ſecrets of State, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments of Princes wiſely diſſimulating with their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from whoſe ambitious pretences Politicians determine that nothing is unlawful to him that hath power, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo unſafe to a Cedar of State, as to be ſecurely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. By the aſſiſtance of Hiſtory we finde out the eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Affairs of their Kingdoms, their Treaties, Articles, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Charts, Ordinances, Entertainments, Proviſions of Arms, Buſineſſes of Commerce. It is indeed one of the moſt profitable employments of a mans life to read Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, which ſtirs up men to vertue, and deterrs from vice, whileſt they read how the one is rewarded, and the other puniſhed; it makes a man ſerviceable both to the Church and State; it is a Study fit for <hi>Divines,</hi> to illuſtrate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Doctrines, whileſt they exhort to vertue, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort from vice; it ſhews them alſo the encreaſe and decreaſe of Religion, with the divers concomitants thereof; it is fit for the <hi>Lawyer,</hi> to ſhew him the original, diverſities, and changes of Laws and Governments; for the ſame cauſe it is a fit Study for all <hi>Princes, Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Politicians,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:116025:11"/>without which their Government will be but lame: and no leſs neceſſary is it to <hi>Souldiers,</hi> eſpecially to <hi>Commanders</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> where they may ſee the the divers cauſes, events, attendants, and ſtratagems of War. <hi>Phyſicians</hi> alſo, <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Poets</hi> may reap no ſmall benefit by reading Hiſtories. <hi>Alexander</hi> made himſelf ſo expert a Warriour as he was, by reading the Life and Actions of <hi>Achilles;</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> was animated to undertake his great exploits by reading the Life of <hi>Alexander. Plutarch</hi> reports, that <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> who ſubdued <hi>Perſes</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian King, attained to his expertneſs in Souldiery, by his indefatigable Study in Hiſtory. <hi>Selymus</hi> the Turk cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the actions of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> to be tranſlated (whereas his Predeceſſours ſlighted all Hiſtories as fabulous) and by reading of theſe, he became ſo expert a Souldier, that in a ſhort time he over-run a great part of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia-Charles</hi> the Great was ſo affected with Hiſtories, that he uſually cauſed them to be read to him as he ſat at dinner and ſupper. And <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> never undertook any great action, till he had firſt conſulted with Hiſtorians. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other examples might be produced of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit attained by reading of Hiſtories; now as they received profit from, ſo were they in ancient times as grateful to Hiſtorians. <hi>Polybius</hi> that wrote the Roman Hiſtory, and their Wars with the Carthaginians, was honoured with a Statue on high Pillar at <hi>Megalopolis. Pompey</hi> the Great honoured <hi>Theophanes</hi> the Hiſtorian with the Priviledges of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Tacitus</hi> commanded the Hiſtory of <hi>Tacitus</hi> to be placed in all Libraries, and leaſt it ſhould periſh, he cauſed it every year to be written ten times over. <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> beſtowed great wealth and honours on <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Jewiſh Hiſtorian, notwithſtanding he had before been his deadly enemy, and cauſed his Statue to be erected at <hi>Rome.</hi> So did <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate upon <hi>Aurelius Victor,</hi> the Roman Hiſtoriographer. We read
<pb facs="tcp:116025:11"/>of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that he commanded the Muſicians from his preſence, ſaying, <hi>He heard a better Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony out of Livy.</hi> The Egyptians were ſo careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Hiſtories and ancient Monuments, that they ſlighted the Grecians, accounting them no better then chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their neglect herein. Hiſtory is the general trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of times paſt, preſent, and a lively pattern of things to come; and as one rightly terms it, the Work-Miſtreſſe of Experience, and Mother of Prudence: by Prudence we finde that a good Prince that is governed by evil Miniſters is in as dangerous a poſture of ruine, as if he were evil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; we diſcover by the ruines of ſome raſh great men what Ambition is, <hi>torrenti ſimilis,</hi> which riſes in an inſtant, and falls in a moment. In the Calamities of a Civil War we may perceive how the Law lies aſleep, and how the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Church are traduced when all things are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Sword, to ſee one brought <hi>a pallio &amp; crepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> from the greateſt obſcurity to the Purple and Scepter; another once in the Meridian of Majeſty, in a ſhort time ſet below in the Horizon of contempt; the ſins of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſited in the progeny of another Prince, of a Prince in a Nation; the hand of God guiding this dance, like the Whitel of a Clock, which moving all the reſt hath not of its ſelf any ſenſible motion; or as we ſee the Circum-ambulation of the lower Spheres, yet ſee not the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> whoſe Revolution whirles them round about.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to conſider the great delight of this Study, then which what can be greater then in Hiſtory, as ſhe reinforces Antiquity from her ruines; what can be nobler then to make the gray head of time white again? what more pleaſant then to look back on that which is not, to ſee great Empires more unknown in their Originals then the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain head of the <hi>Nile,</hi> break out with ſuch violent Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts that they have either over-run or terrified the amazed world, and then in the height of their glory pulled down
<pb facs="tcp:116025:12"/>by ſome unexpected and improbable means, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo annihilated, that they have kept no Tract of their greatneſs, ſave what is found in a piece of paper.</p>
            <p>To draw to a concluſion to my own Addreſſes, as to the right underſtanding of this Volume: I muſt for my own part freely acknowledge, that it is more then the Work of one man, were he of never ſo ſtrong forces, to compoſe a paſſible contexture of the whole Hiſtory of <hi>England;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſomewhat I might ſay for my ſelf, as it is well known I have ſpent ſome years in theſe Studies, but withal I know <hi>quam ſit magnum dare aliquid in manus hominum,</hi> eſpecially in this kinde, where more is expected then hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before; in reſpect of anſwering the height of ſome inſatiate curioſities, this I muſt write for my ſelf, what I may profeſs in ſingleneſſe of heart, that the ambition of my deſign hath been to keep cloſe to truth, which to me hath ſeemed more amiable then all other worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, to which purpoſe I have rendred her as ſhe is pictured, naked, without any unneceſſary tires and advantages of Wit and Eloquence; it having been my chiefeſt endeavour to ſet down things in an even and quiet order, not quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the belief of Antiquity, nor obſeuring the leaſt particle of truth, which I know needs not, though falſhood requires ſupporters. Thus, as to the Authority of what I have writ, I have bound my ſelf to the truth of Hiſtory onely, retaining to my ſelf the right of an Authour, my own liberty: As for the Method, Manner, and Phraſe of writing, for my Authours I have prefixed a Catologue of them, that my Reader may know that I have not (like the men of the times) done things <hi>ex tempore;</hi> if every where I have not charged my Book with them, it is becauſe the Hiſtory for the Impartiality of it is Authour to its ſelf; onely to avoid too often citations; where I could not go abroad, as one writes, the reſt I have taken in at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. I acknowledge I had many ſupplies beſides my own
<pb facs="tcp:116025:12"/>ſome years continued ſtudies, I have converſed with the moſt knowing perſons of unqueſtionable eſteem, intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in moſt of the late Actions, I have had the uſe of their Manuſcripts, conſulted with Records, turned over many Volumes, ſo that my Reader as to the grand compoſure of this Work ſhall finde nothing ſo looſe, though one Life ſometimes relates to another, but that with <hi>Lipſius</hi> his ſoder he may cement them together in their main poſition, as they will lead him by the hand into the Eſcurial of the Hiſtory. One writes that our Hiſtorians are now adayes not crook-back'd, as is reported of the Jews, but crook-ſided, warped, and bowed to the right or to the left; for my part I have declared my ſelf unbyaſſed, that poſterity may know that ſome durſt ſtill write Truth, whileſt other mens fancies are more light then their hands. As it is impoſſible for any man to ground a true Hiſtory upon the printed Pamphlets of theſe times, ſuch things as paſſe the Preſſe without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, ſo lamentable is our condition, that in ſuch a Harveſt of Printing we ſhould have ſo few true Hiſtorians; on the one ſide being either ſtifled with Pamphlets, or on the other oppreſſed with monſtrous ſwelled Volumes, able to wear out the eyes with reading, the hand in turning, or the memory in receiving. I muſt beg pardon if I have imitated <hi>Tacitus,</hi> of whom one may ſay without partiality, that he hath written the moſt matter with the beſt conceit, in the feweſt words of any Hiſtorian. For my own part I am ſo greedy of well doing, as that nothing ſuffices the appetite of my care herein; I had rather be maſter of a ſmall piece handſomely contrived, then of vaſt Rooms ill proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unfurniſht. As for this Piece which I have extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of divers Hiſtorians, and contracted into a brief Epitome, I have endeavoured to ſet down in it all remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſages in as little room as I could, the Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs whereof will be uſeful and acceptable to moſt ſorts of men; as firſt to thoſe who by reaſon of their other ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:116025:13"/>and employments in the world have no leaſure to read over the many Volumes of Hiſtories which have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; in reading of this they ſhall not need to ſpend much time, which is but ſhort, and every wiſe man will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to husband it as well as he can. 2. To thoſe who have no patience to dwell too long upon prolix and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hiſtories, from reading of which many are deterred, as growing weary before they be half way, deſpairing ever to attain the end of their journey. 3. To theſe alſo <hi>(Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus res anguſta domi)</hi> who either cannot becauſe of their narrow means, or will not becauſe of their narrow mindes, part with too much money on Books; in this, they that cannot reach to the price of a long Gown, may buy a ſhort Cloak. Laſtly, the benefit will accrew to all men who read this Hiſtory, that they ſhall buy at a far cheaper rate the experiences of others recorded here, then they can buy their own; for they that live long and travel far, pay ſoundly for their experience; but they who read Hiſtories enjoy the experience of all that lived before, which is far greater and much cheaper. My onely fear is, leſt by eſſaying or epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizing, I ſhould treſpaſs too much on the ſoil of other mens inventions or judgements, as to prejudice truth or the perſons whoſe mutual off-ſprings they are; but theſe things being but by the by, the Reader will not much ſet by them. I ſhall therefore come to the main and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſiderations; this Hiſtory though it begins with a diſtance of time, yet the diſcerning Reader ſhall finde, that it is not ſo far off that the foot-ſteps of time are worne out; and for thoſe paſſages that have come neareſt to our times, I have in my inquiſitions gone betwixt the Bark and the Tree; what I have mentioned in Letters I know from whoſe cloſet they came, they are many of them never before printed, of the Caballa of State, of thoſe of which Sir <hi>Robert Naunton</hi> ſayes, if they could have been procured, would have told pretty tales of the times.
<pb facs="tcp:116025:13"/>If there be any perſons living, who though they are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, will ſtill reflect ſo far on themſelves as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſuch if they rightly underſtand themſelves, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be much diſpleaſed, ſince they may imagine what will be ſaid of them in plain truth hereafter: this I am certain of; I have not intermixed any paſſion in my relations, to make my ſelf a party, in which ſome have ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better Advocates then Hiſtorians; all that I ſhall pretend to in this work, is no more then a bare narrative of matter of fact, digeſted into order of time, interpoſing of my own opinion in the interpretation of actions; all which traverſes, as I have already expreſſed, I have infuſed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vinegar nor Gall into my ink; if I mention a charge or impeachment, it relates to the defence that was made by the accuſed. To be brief, in this ſmall Volume the Reader may ſee the proſperous and torne eſtates of Princes and other perſons, the declination of the Cleargy, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Souldiery; in all which tranſactions, one life will ſmooth the way for another, that he that conſiders the one without the other, ſees but with one eye; indeed the chief materials this Volume is built up of, are of the exploits and ſucceſſes of my own Countreymen, as well in their forreign expeditions, as what was tranſacted at home. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of this Volume, amongſt the lives and draughts of the Worthies, I muſt acknowledge through the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of friends, who prevailed with my pen. I have inſerted ſome few inferiour Lives, amongſt the reſt Maſter <hi>Lilburnes,</hi> which though not agreeing with the title of my Book, may as I have in his ſtrange life expreſſed, <hi>paſs as a Wonder,</hi> for ſome of the Royaliſts at the latter end of the Volume, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I would have defaced my endeavours, and ſpoiled the intention of my deſign, I could not but particularize them; as otherwiſe I muſt have made by themſelves two little Volumes of the late King and the Protector, to the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alteration, if not the ſpoiling the method of my deſigns;
<pb facs="tcp:116025:14"/>as they are ſucceſſively placed, ſo their enemies, if they love to read of their own ſad triumphs of their former actions, they will appear even to them as ſo many beauty ſpots in the face of this Epitome of the Engliſh Hiſtory. There are ſeveral other Lives which were never before writ, theſe as I had no track in Hiſtory to finde out the ſeries of their tranſactions, coſt me many hours of converſation with their friends and ſuch as beſt knew them, from whom I received ſuch light, as that together with their own ſo well known ſplendours, their more Heroick publick deportments, which to me as alſo to themſelves were their own Hiſtory, though it hath been my good fortune to repreſent them in their ſtill ſurviving pictures, which I queſtion not but this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age as alſo poſterity will be very well pleaſed with. In the choice of theſe lives I have not ſo much tickled my own fancy, as purſued our Engliſh Hiſtory in no ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but ſuch a one as to my knowledge the like is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in our Engliſh tongue; the general way of writing being of the Chronicles of the Kings, which path in my opinion had been too vulgar, and too much trode in: the lives of particular perſons being in them either obſcured or too lightly toucht on; whereas giving them their due luſtre, theſe Diamonds, as relating to the Crown, with their ſplendor illumniate the ſeveral Reigns as they fall in their ſucceſſion of time; and though every Prince is not inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſo vulgarly known, nevertheleſs his ſtory in theſe Heroes is for the main continued. I ſhall excuſe my omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe late Princes, <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> as the people have from their continued reading their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions imprinted in their mindes. For thoſe that are ſtill behinde hand, that are not verſed in the Engliſh Hiſtory, I thought fit to give them this ſhort advice for the election of their Authors; <hi>Speed</hi> may be entertained though his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume be large, he hath fewer impertinencies then ſome
<pb facs="tcp:116025:14"/>other more volumnious Hiſtorians. Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> is to be honoured for his handſome ſtile and method; theſe two Authors the Student may make uſe of as intire in themſelves, though without diſpute our Engliſh Hiſtory hath been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred beſt in parts; the writers having beſtowed more pains, and have been more intent upon the Reigns they have undertook. Thus the Readers beſt way will be to take the admirable <hi>Daniel,</hi> the moſt ſuccinct Authour, and the moſt judicious and notable for his cenſures, he writes from the beginning of our Story to <hi>Richard</hi> the Second. Then he muſt make as good a ſhift as he can with <hi>Truſſel,</hi> who writes <hi>ad rem,</hi> though not with ſo acute a pen; he goes unto <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, whoſe Reign above all others read the Lord <hi>Verulam.</hi> Thence proceed to peruſe Biſhop <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> whoſe Annals contain <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> the incomparable <hi>Cambden</hi> goes on with Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The parcel Hiſtorians that have done excellently in particular Lives, are Sir <hi>John Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Habington,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> Mr. <hi>Le-Strange,</hi> Squire <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> and others. But I fear I have already been too tedious, I ſhall immediately conclude with this requeſt, that for the errours and failings of my pen, as it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying, <hi>Humanum eſt errare,</hi> ſo I ſubmit my pen to the cenſures of the more learned, entreating them in their better Judgements to correct my unwilling miſtakes; for the overſight of printing I ſhall onely crave pardon of courſe, as it is a fate common to Books and Book-men not to be avoided; whatſoever the faults are; let them redound to my ſelf, I wiſh the profit to others, but above all attribute the Glory to God.</p>

               <p>At ſuch time as he was Caeſar under <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was left at <hi>Rome</hi> as Hoſtage with <hi>Galerius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; but perceiving his death to be by him attempted, he poſted to <hi>Brittain</hi> in all haſte to his father, who was newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the City of <hi>York</hi> from an expedition he had made againſt the Picts and Caledonians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantius</hi> at the time of his ſons arrival was ſick of the Plague, whereof he died immediately afterwards; the ſight of his ſon at the preſent ſo revived his ſpirits, that raiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his bed, he ſet the Crown Imperial upon his head, and in the preſence of his Privy Councellours ſpake to this effect.</p>
               <p>Now is my death to me more welcome, and my departure hence more pleaſant, ſeeing I ſhall leave my unaccompliſhed actions to be performed by thee my Son; in whoſe perſon I queſtion not but that my memorial ſhall be retained as in a monument of eternal fame. What I had intended, (but by death prevented) ſee thou accompliſh; let thine Empire be governed uprightly by Juſtice, protecting the innocents from the tyranny of oppreſſours, wiping away all tears from the eyes of Chriſtians; for therein above all things have I eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf happy: to thee therefore I commend my Diadem, and their defence, taking my Faults along with me to my grave, but leaving my Vertues to revive and live in thee. With the concluſion of which words he concluded his life, leaving his Subjects ſorrowful for his departure; but the grief they received by the death of the Father, was mittigated in the hopes they conceived of his Son, who ſo reſembled his Father in all vertuous conditions, that though the Emperour was changed, yet his good government remained: For as one writes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> thus choſen Emperour in <hi>Brittain,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Emperour by the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> who (like the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) adored the riſing Sun, giving approbation to what they could not remedy; his firſt expedition was againſt the Picts and Caledonians, which War his Father had begun, but death prevented him to finiſh it, leaving the proſecution thereof to his ſon <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that the Fabrick of ſo many victories by him atchieved, might have the foundation thereof laid in <hi>Brittain:</hi> nor was his ſucceſs contrary to his expectation, ſubduing the inhabitants that were moſt remote witneſſes (ſaith one) of the ſuns ſet, or going down.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at the time of his ſetting forth of <hi>Brittain,</hi> was (as appeareth by Authours) unſettled in his Religion; for though he obſerved the adoration of the Gods of the Gentiles to be altogether frivolous and deceitful, yet was he not confirmed in the Chriſtian Faith, but was then rather of no Religion, then truly of any; the cauſe of his converſion, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> and other Authours write, was, that being in his march againſt <hi>Maxentius</hi> aforeſaid, being then piouſly affected to worſhip and to invocate the true God, he caſt his eyes towards the Eaſt part of the Heavens, and had preſented unto him the ſign of a Croſs, wherein were ſtars as letters ſo placed, that viſibly might be read this ſentence, <hi>IN HOC VINCE;</hi> this ſign being ſeconded by the voice of Angels, confirmed him in that whereof before he was doubtful, ſo that changing the Imperial Standard to the form of this viſion, as one arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven, he marched againſt his helliſh Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>Who thinking to over-reach <hi>Conſtantine</hi> by a ſtratagem, framed a falſe bridge over the River of <hi>Tybur,</hi> but the trap he ſet for another he fell into himſelf; for joyning battel with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and being by him overcome, either for haſte or forgetfulneſs, took over the ſame himſelf, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under him as he paſſed, he with many more were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſcaping thereby a more cruel and ignominious death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who then governed the Eaſt part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, hearing of the proſperous proceedings of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> purpoſed the deſtruction of him and all his partakers: but man propoſeth, and God diſpoſeth; for he who dreamt of nothing leſs then a glorious victory, was himſelf overcome by <hi>Licinius</hi> at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> where he ſhortly after died, being eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up with lice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Licinius</hi> hereupon growing inſolent, his proſperous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings making him ambitiouſly mad, was in conceit no leſs then Emperour of the whole world; ſo that now he began to unvizard himſelf, and to ſhow he was not what he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116025:19"/>for though before he had outwardly ſuffered the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion, yet now he raiſed a bloody perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in the Eaſt. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> according to his Fathers commandment (which was to wipe away all tears from the Chriſtians eyes) prepared his forces againſt this bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, with whom he encountred in the Countrey of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> his ſucceſs being anſwerable to the juſtneſs of his cauſe, <hi>Licinius</hi> and his Army being overthrown; but he afterwards recruting, in a battel at <hi>Byzantium</hi> was again overthrown and taken priſoner; yet by the mediation of his wife <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> had his life ſpared and confined within the City of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media:</hi> but he afterwards endeavouring to recover his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dignity, was for his treaſons afterwards put to death, ſo that then (as Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> writes) the peace of Gods Saints manifeſtly appeared, and the progreſs of the Goſpel paſſed uncontrolled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maxentius, Maximinus,</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> being vanquiſhed, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> remained ſole Emperour, under whom the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians enjoyed Halcyon dayes, returning from the deſerts where before they were hidden; Churches were reedified, Temples founded, and Feſtival Dayes celebrated in every place. And that this foundation might have as glorious a building, he congregated 318 Chriſtian Biſhops in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Nice,</hi> where divers things were decreed for the godly government of the Church in that primitive Age.</p>
               <p>His next care was to demoliſh and pull down idolatrous Temples and Images, as the Grove and Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Phenicia,</hi> which was a School of wickedneſs to thoſe which were addicted to luſt; where men and women frequently committed adulteries and fornications. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> thinking it unfit that the ſun ſhould behold ſuch villany, ſent a band of Souldiers to ſuppreſs it: as alſo the Temple of <hi>Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> with the Image of <hi>Venus</hi> at <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> and many ſuch like in other places. Nor was his zeal more ſhown in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Pagan Temples, then in erecting ſtructures for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116025:20"/>advancing of Chriſtianity, building a moſt magnificent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the very place where our Saviours Sepulchre was, though ſome report it to have been built by his Mother <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena;</hi> but we will not herein ſet the Mother and Son at odds, it may be ſhe built it at his coſt, or that it was built by him, and dedicated by her; as alſo thoſe other two, the one on the Mountain where our Saviour Aſcended, the other over the Cave where he was Born. The Kingdome of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to appear thus viſibly reſplendent, the Devil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying the proſperity thereof, raiſed a new ſedition in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och;</hi> the whole City being divided into two factions about the choice of a Biſhop: <hi>Conſtantine</hi> well knowing that the War of the Church was the Infidels Peace, wrote perſwaſive letters to them to maintain peace and concord among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which like lenitive Phyſick allay'd and cool'd the hot diſtempers of their rage, who elſe had certainly killed and maſacred one another.</p>
               <p>Hitherto is <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> reign commended of moſt, but the latter part of his life applauded of few. In the firſt beginning of his reign (ſaith <hi>Stow</hi>) he was worthy to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the chiefeſt Princes of the Romans; but for the end thereof, to be reſembled to ſuch as were of the meaner ſort. <hi>Eutropius</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> tax him of cruelty, for putting to death his wife <hi>Fauſta</hi> and <hi>Criſpus</hi> his ſon, though he be thereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by <hi>Paulus Oroſius</hi> and <hi>Zoſimus,</hi> who affirme the cauſes of there deaths were juſt. However, he is taxed by other writers to have more prejudiced the Roman Empire then any of his predeceſſours; firſt in removing the Imperiall ſeat from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Bizantium,</hi> adorning the ſame with magnificent buildings, and commanding all the Princes of the Empire to raiſe therein ſome memorable edifices. Likewiſe for tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Rome</hi> more curious ſtatues, and other coſtly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, then any twenty of his predeceſſours had brought thither: as the Image of the <hi>Goddeſs Pallas,</hi> ſuppoſed to be the ſame that <hi>Aeneas</hi> brought from <hi>Troy;</hi> the Image of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116025:20"/>
                  <hi>Apollo,</hi> of an unmeaſurable higneſs, with the ſtatues of <hi>Juno, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Minerva;</hi> where he alſo built a famous Library, wherein were an hundred and twenty thouſand Books: changing the name to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which it ſtill retaineth unto this day. Another errour of this famous Prince, was his dividing the Empire between his Children; for though (ſaith our learned Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>) it was quickly again reunited, yet by his example others learned the ſame leſſon, renting the Empire into many pieces, which finally occaſioned the loſs of the whole. Another defect was his tranſlating the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Brittain, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> unto the Eaſtern Countrey, for a Bulwark againſt the Perſians, thereby opening a gap for the barbarous Nations to enter, which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſoon did to the great prejudice of the Empire; ſo that <hi>Zoſimus</hi> (though in other of his writings concerning this Emperour diſcovers his malice) yet he truly calleth him the firſt ſubverter of that flouriſhing Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Concerning the time when he was baptized Authors onely agree in diſagreeing; <hi>Euſebius</hi> writes, that he was baptized in the City of <hi>Nicomedia; Sozomenus</hi> and <hi>Theodoritus,</hi> that it was a little before his death; others think he was baptized with <hi>Criſpus</hi> his Son, to which opinion accords <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> who affirm the Font wherein they were baptized, to have remained unto their times. In this diverſity of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Reader muſt not expect I ſhould ſatisfie him, ſeeing I cannot herein ſatisfie my ſelf.</p>
               <p>But of more certainty is the place of his death, wherein they all accord, that it was in <hi>Nicomedia</hi> a City of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> where he died of a natural diſeaſe, a thing to be taken notice of, ſince of 40. Emperours that reigned before him, above 30. of them came to untimely ends, moſt of them being blood-thirſty Tyrants, and Perſecutours of Gods holy Saints, whoſe ends were anſwerable to their lives, their bloody acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons having bloody deaths: So true is that of the Poet <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But ſcarcely was the Crown ſettled on his head, when the Saxons ſought to ſtrike it off, who being called in by <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerne</hi> for an aid againſt the Scots and Picts, like unmannerly gueſts ſought to turn their hoaſt out of doors. To the aid of theſe Saxons joyned <hi>Lotho</hi> King of <hi>Picts,</hi> out of envy to the Brittains, for that they had denied him to be their King; and although <hi>Arthur</hi> was his Kinſman, and profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, the other ſtrangers and enemies to true Religion, yet neither Chriſtianity nor Conſanguinity could keep him from joyning with them in amity, not caring who won, ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116025:22"/>
                  <hi>Arthur</hi> did but loſe. The firſt battel they fought was in the Countrey of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> where <hi>Arthur</hi> dyed his Sword in the Saxons blood, chaſing them from thence to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>York,</hi> which notwithſtanding he did ſtraitly beſiege, yet their Captain named <hi>Colgerne</hi> eſcaped from thence, and got into <hi>Germany</hi> where he obtained aid of one <hi>Cherdike</hi> a King of that Countrey, who came himſelf in perſon, with 70 ſail of ſhips, and having a proſperous Winde arrived in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which when <hi>Arthur</hi> underſtood, he raiſed his ſiege, and marched towards <hi>London.</hi> And that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his enemies might not daunt the courage of his Souldiers, he ſent for aid to his Nephew <hi>Howel,</hi> King of little <hi>Brittain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who came himſelf likewiſe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the aid of his uncle, doing, as old Authors write, acts worthy to be eternized with a golden pen.</p>
               <p>Their forces thus augmented, with undaunted reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they march to the City of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> which <hi>Cherdike</hi> did then beſiege, whom they forced from thence to flee into a wood, but there being likewiſe compaſſed about with <hi>Arthurs</hi> victorious Army, they yielded themſelves with condition to depart the Land, leaving the <hi>Brittains</hi> their horſe, armour, and other furniture: but ſee what faith is to be expected from faithleſs people, for having their markets ſpoiled at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> they thought to make them good in the Weſt, ariving at <hi>Totnes,</hi> and deſtroying all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey till they came to <hi>Bathe;</hi> but the price of their lives paid for their perjury, being encountred by <hi>Arthur,</hi> their Army was overthrown, their three Captains <hi>Colgrine, Cherdike,</hi> and <hi>Bladulf</hi> being ſlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howel</hi> King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Nephew was not at this laſt battel, being beſieged at that preſent in the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whoſe reſcue haſted <hi>Arthur,</hi> with the flower of his Souldiers; and notwithſtanding the Scots were aided by one <hi>Guillomer</hi> King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet obtained he of them a glorious victory, chaſing <hi>Guillomer</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Returning to <hi>Yorke</hi> he inſtituted the celebration of the Nativity of our Lord, with ſuch feaſts and ſports as are commonly now uſed; an inſtitution which the Scottiſh wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do altogether condemn, comparing them to the feaſt of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Priapus</hi> of old, it being a time more fit for our devotion then mirth.</p>
               <p>His wife was named <hi>Guinever,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and near Kinſwoman to <hi>Cador</hi> Duke or Earl of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> a Lady who for her beauty was the miracle of her times, had it not been accompained with a vicious minde; not onely abuſing her ſelf by unlawfully accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying with <hi>Mordred,</hi> ſon to <hi>Lotho</hi> Kng of <hi>Picts,</hi> but alſo in her husbands abſence conſented to be his wife; ſo rarely is beauty and chaſtity found to dwell in one body, that it hath cauſed many writers for the faults of ſome few to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the whole ſex; amongſt the reſt take theſe of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramatiſt.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>A woman is not to be credited,</l>
                  <l>If you will credit me, though ſhe be dead.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And again in another place.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>There is not one good woman to be found:</l>

               </q>
               <p>Thus ſome in their critick fancies think all women to be bad, and others again as much contrary think them all to be good, certainly every man ſpeaks as he findes, and by the knowledge of one paſſes judgement of all the reſt. That they are all bad, I cannot think it: and that they are all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116025:23"/>good, I could never finde it: ſure he that thought them all good; was too much feminine, and he that concluded them all to be bad, had forgotten that ere he had a mother.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Hiſtory. King <hi>Arthur</hi> to increaſe the courage of his Souldiers, inſtituted the Order of Knights of the Round Table, that he might reward the well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with titles of Honour: none were admitted into this order but ſuch of the Nobility as were moſt renouned for vertue and Chevalry; they were in all the number of 150 the chiefeſt of them being Sir <hi>Lancelot,</hi> Sir <hi>Triſtram,</hi> Sir <hi>Lamrock,</hi> Sir <hi>Gawine</hi> and others. Theſe were all recorded for Knights of great renown; and had not King <hi>Arthurs</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour been moſt tranſcendent, each of them might have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for no leſs then a Worthy, though they muſt fall ſhort of the deeds of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> of whom it is written, that in one battel againſt the Saxons, with his Sword named <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libourn,</hi> he ſlew above 800 of them, ſo much his valour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all others, if my Authors words exceed not the truth.</p>
               <p>In twelve ſet Battels (beſides ſeveral Skirmiſhes) is he ſaid to have returned victor from the ſlaughter of the Saxons; the names of the places where theſe battels were fought, take here out of <hi>Ninius.</hi>

               <p>King <hi>Arthur</hi> in theſe battels having broken the force of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116025:23"/>the Saxons, and not onely forced them to pay him tribute, but to receive Majeſtrates of his appointment; yet thought the glory of his actions to ſuffer an eclipſe, if his victories were atcheived onely in Great <hi>Brittain;</hi> therefore with a well ſelected Army he paſſes over into <hi>Norway,</hi> ſubduing the ſame with all the Regions thereabouts; cauſing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe Countries to receive the Chiſtian Religion, and obtained of the Pope to have <hi>Norway</hi> confirmed to the Crown of this Realm, cauſing it to be called the Chamber of <hi>Brittain.</hi> Then ſailing into <hi>France</hi> he put <hi>Frolo</hi> (Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour there for the Romans) to flight, and afterwards in combate manfully ſlew him.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding his wonderfull atchievements, yet <hi>Lucius Hiberus</hi> the Roman Legate demanded of him a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute for <hi>Brittain;</hi> which he not onely denyed, but alſo threatned to have a tribute from <hi>Rome,</hi> as appeareth in his letters ſent unto the Senate, where I finde it thus written in an old Manuſcript. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand among you of</hi> Rome, <hi>that I am King</hi> Arthur <hi>of</hi> Brittain, <hi>and freely it hold and ſhall hold; and at</hi> Rome <hi>haſtily will I be, not to give you truage, but to have truage of you: for</hi> Conſtantine <hi>that was</hi> Hellens <hi>Son, and other of mine Anceſtors conquered</hi> Rome, <hi>and thereof were Emperours, and that they had and held, I ſhall have yours Goddis grace;</hi> and accordingly he ſet forward againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Hiberus,</hi> who with great power and vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence came marching againſt him; where after a long and bloody fight the Romans were diſcomfited, their General killed, and his ſlain body ſent to the Senate for the tribute of <hi>Brittain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Arthur</hi> was thus buſied in conquering Kingdoms abroad, he had well near loſt his kingdome at home; for in his abſence his Couzen <hi>Mordred</hi> (confederating himſelf with <hi>Cerdicus</hi> King of the Weſt Saxons) uſurped the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: which when <hi>Arthur</hi> underſtood, he returned into <hi>Brittain,</hi> and at <hi>Cambula</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi> this brittiſh <hi>Hector</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:116025:24"/>encountring with <hi>Mordred</hi> ſlew him; but himſelf being deadly wounded, was conveyed to <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> where he dyed on the 21 day of <hi>May,</hi> in the year of our ſalvation 542. when he had victoriouſly governed the Brittains the ſpace of ſix and twenty years.</p>
               <p>Here might we end his life, were he not further remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by our Modern Authours, <hi>viz.</hi> how in the laſt year of the reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, more then 600. years after the time of his death, his body was found in the Church-yard of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> betwixt two Pyramides therein ſtanding: he was laid no leſſe then ſixteen foot deep in the ground, for fear (as <hi>Hollinſhead</hi> writes) the Saxons ſhould have found him; and ſurely the ſearchers for his body would have never digged ſo deep, had they not at ſeven foot depth found a mighty broad ſtone, to which a leaden Croſſe was faſtened, and in that ſide that lay downwards, in barbarous Letters (according to the rudeneſſe of that Age) this Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption was written upon that ſide of the lead that was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſtone.</p>

                  <l>Hic jacet ſepultus inclytus Rex Arturius.</l>

               <p>Nine foot deeper, in the trunk of a tree, was his body found buried: his bones being of a marvellous bigneſſe, the ſpace of his forehead betwixt his two eyes (if I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Hiſtorians ſtrange narration) was a ſpan broad, and his ſhin-bone being ſet in the ground, reached up to the middle thigh of a very tall man; ten wounds appeared in his ſcull, one whereof was very great and plain to be ſeen; his wife Queen <hi>Guinever</hi> lay buried likewiſe with him, the treſſes of whoſe hair, the laſt of our excrements that periſh, finely platted, and of colour like the burniſht gold, ſeemed whole and perfect until it was touched, but then (to ſhew what all beauties are) it immediately fell to duſt. <hi>Henry de Bloys</hi> (then Abbot of that houſe) tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116025:24"/>their bones into the great new Church, (for the old one was burned not long before) and there interred them in a ſumptuous Tomb of Marble, laying the body of the King at the head of the Tomb, and the body of the Queen at his feet towards the Weſt part; which noble monument (ſaith Mr. <hi>Speed</hi>) among the fatall overthrows of infinite more, was altogether razed at the diſpoſe of ſome then in Commiſſion, whoſe over-haſty actions in theſe behalfs, hath left us a want of many truths which otherwiſe we might have had.</p>
               <p>Vain therefore is that which the Scottiſh Hiſtorians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that Queen <hi>Guinever</hi> was buried at <hi>Angus</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and that what woman ſoever chanceth to tread upon her grave, ſhall remain for ever barren, without bringing forth any iſſue, inſomuch (as <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> a lying Author reports) no woman dares not come near it her ſelf, nor will ſuffer any of her daughters to come near there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

               <p>IN reſpect of this unuſual Tract, as alſo of the ſtrange va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of relations I have found in Authors of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; I thought fit from the Sword to come to the Croſier, to ſelect the Life of <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that poſterity may be acquainted with the ſucceſſes as well of the Mitre as Crown. He was born in Weſt-<hi>Saxon,</hi> his Father was named <hi>Heorſtan,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Cinifride;</hi> they in his youth ſet him to ſchool, where he ſo profitted, that he excelled moſt then living of his age: in proceſs of time he fell ſick of an Ague, which was ſo violent that he fell into a frenzy, (Phyſicians belike being ſcarce in that age) he was, as my Author writes, under cure of a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but through her unskilfulneſs his diſeaſe increaſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and one day being in a trance, he ſuddenly aroſe, and catching hold of a ſtaff, laid about him, as (indeed he was) mad; next night he got up on the roof of the Church, running up and down on the ſame as if it had been on the ground, and coming ſafely down without any hurt;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116025:25"/>theſe effects of frenzy were reputed by the ſuperſtitious men of thoſe times for miracles: hereupon his Father made him a Prieſt, and placed him in the Abby of <hi>Glaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> from whence he was ſoon advanced into the ſervice of King <hi>Ethelſtone,</hi> and as ſoon baniſhed the Court, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Necromancy; for entring one day into a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans houſe, he hung his harp on the wall whilſt he ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a Prieſts ſtoal, when to make him merry at his work his harp began to play, which the common people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be done by the devil, though the ſubject of its ſong was ſaid to be that Hymne, <hi>Gaudent in coelis animae ſanctorum,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf is ſaid to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace him with her ſongs, <hi>Cantemus Domino ſociae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Being thus expulſed the Court his Couzen <hi>Elfheagus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> perſwaded him to become a Monk, that what preferment the Court denied, by means of the Church he might obtain: but he loathing a ſingle life, and having a minde to marry ſome beautiful Damſel, refuſed ſo to do, but a ſickneſs of his body healed this diſeaſe of his minde; for being ſtricken with a ſwelling in his belly, his body was brought into ſuch ſtate, as if he had been infected with a Leproſie; whereupon no ſooner was he recovered but he went to the Biſhop, who ſhore him a Monk: in which ſtate of life he remined with ſuch opinion of holineſs, that whereas before he was reported to be a Necromancer, he was now reputed to be no leſs then a Saint: ſo variable are the opinions of the people, being all in extreams, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no medium, as the Poet hath it:</p>

                  <hi>Edred</hi> being dead, his Nephew <hi>Edwy</hi> ſucceeded him in his Kingdome; altogether unlike his uncle in conditions, young in years, but viceous in life; for the very ſame day on which he was Crowned, he abuſed his Body with a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy his near Kinſwoman; and after, adding murther to inceſt, ſlew her Husband, that he might enjoy her as his Wife: for theſe and other notorious offences being boldly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> he baniſhed him the Realm; at whoſe departure the devil is ſaid to rejoyce, and to laugh aloud
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116025:27"/>at the Weſt end of the Church; to whom <hi>Dunſtan</hi> (as it were by way of Prophecy) ſaid, Well thou adverſary, do not ſo greatly rejoyce at the matter, for thou doeſt not now ſo much rejoyce at my departure, but by Gods grace thou ſhalt be as ſorrowful for my return.</p>
               <p>All the time of King <hi>Edwy's</hi> reign, which was but ſhort, (for Tyrants ſeldome are long lived) he remained at the Monaſtery of <hi>Gaunt</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he received much friendſhip from the Governour of that Countrey; but <hi>Edwy</hi> dying, his brother <hi>Edgar</hi> ſucceeded in the Kingdome, who unraveling the web his brother had weaved, recalled <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> out of baniſhment; making him firſt Biſhop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> after of <hi>London;</hi> and laſt of all beſtowed the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury</hi> upon him. This <hi>Edgar</hi> had <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> in high eſtimation, by whoſe advice (the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to exceſſive quaffing, he put down many Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and would ſuffer but one to be in a Town: and the more to deterr them from this ſwiniſh vice, he ordained certain cups with pins or nails; and made a law, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever drunk paſt that mark at one draught, ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a certain penalty. No doubt this was an act accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto God, and great need hath theſe times of another <hi>Edgar</hi> or <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> to deterr people from this beaſtly ſin; and to put down the multiplicity of Alehouſes, which now abound in every corner; of which one of our modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets as followeth:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The way to Churches is o'regrown with graſs,</l>
                  <l>But to the Alehouſe fair and plain to paſs.</l>
                  <l>And what is it think you doth cauſe it ſo?</l>
                  <l>But more to th' Alehouſe then to Church do go?</l>
                  <l>Then what may we expect of this ſame evil?</l>
                  <l>Some may to God, but moſt will to the devil.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edgar</hi> dying, great troubles enſued about the election of one of his ſons to ſucceed him; moſt of the Nobles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining for young <hi>Ethelred; Dunſtan</hi> and the Monks ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116025:28"/>as ſtiffly for Prince <hi>Edward:</hi> at laſt a Council being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to argue the matter, the Archbiſhop came in with his Banner and Croſs, and not ſtaying for further debating, preſented Prince <hi>Edward</hi> for their lawful King; and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly conſiſting moſt of Clergy-men, drew the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the reſt; and ſo he was Crowned King at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> by Archbiſhop <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> the year of our Lord 975.</p>
               <p>Theſe troubles thus quieted about the Crown, far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aroſe concerning the Church, for <hi>Alferus</hi> Duke of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> favouring married Prieſts, would ſuffer no Monks to live in his Province: on the other ſide <hi>Edelwyn</hi> Duke of <hi>Eaſt-Anglia,</hi> and <hi>Brightnoth</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> favouring the Monks, expulſed the married Prieſts out of their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Theſe ſparks at laſt increaſt to ſuch a flame, that it was deemed nought but the blood of one ſide would quench the ſame; but upon better advice they laid arms aſide, and referred the matter to be debated in a Council at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where the Monks cauſe (as being worſted) had undoubtedly had the foyl, had they not referred the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be decided by the Rood where the Council ſate: to this Oracle Saint <hi>Dunſtan</hi> deſired them to pray, and to give diligent ear to what it ſhould ſpeak, for the juggling Monks had placed a Man behinde a Wall, who through a trunck delivered theſe words to the beguiled Prieſts, <hi>God forbid it ſhould be ſo, God forbid it ſhould be ſo; you judged well once, but ye may not change well again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this deceit of the Monks being diſcerned by the Prieſts, another aſſembly was held at <hi>Cleve</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire;</hi> where whilſt they were arguing with bitter invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other, the joyſts of the loft wherein they ſat ſuddenly brake, and down fell the floar with the people thereon; many were mained and ſome ſlain, onely Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Dunſtan</hi> remained unhurt, for the poſts whereon his chair was ſet (as it were by miracle) remained untouched. By this fall of the Floar, fell the cauſe of the Prieſts and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116025:28"/>
                  <hi>Dunſtan</hi> deemed a demy God. To this wooden miracle of his, popiſh writers add another of the ſame nature: namely, how a huge beam of a houſe being ſunk out of the frame, and like to ruinate the whole building, with onely making the ſign of the Croſs thereon with his fingers, he made it return to his former place. All the time of King <hi>Edwards</hi> reign was <hi>Dunſtan</hi> had in high eſteem; but he being too good a Prince to live in ſo bad an age, was bereft of his life by the cruelty of his ſtep-mother, that her own ſon might ſucceed in the kingdome. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> diſallowing this act of the Queens, refuſed to Crown her ſon King; at length againſt his will he was compelled to ſolemnize his rights at <hi>Kingſton</hi> on <hi>Thames,</hi> the 14. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> 979.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ethelred</hi> favoured not greatly the Monks, and therefore he was as little reſpected of them in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; who report him to be ſloathful perſon, neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in action, nor fortunate in proceedings: at the time of his Baptiſm he is ſaid to defile the Fount with his ordure: whereupon <hi>Dunſtan</hi> being troubled in his minde, By the Lord (ſaith he) and his bleſſed Mother, this childe ſhall prove to be a ſlothful perſon. But the greateſt matter laid to his charge was his making War upon the Biſhop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> whoſe peace being it would not be procured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the payment of a hundred pound in Gold; <hi>Dunſtan</hi> ſent him word that ſince he made more account of Gold then of God, more of money then of Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> Patron of the Church of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and more of covetouſneſs then of him being the Archbiſhop, the miſchiefs which the Lord had threatned ſhould ſhortly come to paſs, but the ſame ſhould not chance whilſt he was alive; he is likewiſe ſaid to have foreſeen the invaſions of the Danes, and to have foretold the miſeries that ſoon after fell upon the Engliſh Nation; as that they ſhould not be free from Blood and the Sword till there came a people of an unknown tongue, that ſhould bring them to thraldome; which predictions
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116025:29"/>of his, ſoon after his death came to paſſe, as appears in the following Life of King <hi>Edmund;</hi> this Clergy-man now waxing old, the thread of his life being ſpun out to the laſt, he was forced to yield to that from which none are exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the tyranny of death; having taſted liberally in his time of the favours of Fortune; which notwithſtanding could not keep him from dying: ſo true is that of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poet.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Each living Corps muſt yield at laſt to death,</l>
                  <l>And every life muſt loſe his vital breath:</l>
                  <l>The ſoul of man, that onely lives on high,</l>
                  <l>And is an image of eternity.</l>
               </q>
               <p>He dyed on a Saturday the 25. of <hi>May,</hi> the Year of our Lord 989. Happy in this, that he lived not to ſee the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Countrey, which happened preſently after his death.</p>

               <p>THe learned Philoſopher <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, that <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> that eloquent Orator obtained the name of <hi>Cicero,</hi> by reaſon he had a thing upon the tip of his noſe, as it had beeen a riche peaſe; whereupon they ſirnamed him <hi>Cicero,</hi> becauſe <hi>Cicer</hi> in Engliſh ſignifieth a riche peaſe. So likewiſe we read of <hi>Ovid,</hi> that darling of the Muſes, that he got the name of <hi>Naſonis,</hi> from the greatneſs of his Noſe; and in the peruſual of our Engliſh Hiſtories we ſhall meet with many of the like examples, as of <hi>William</hi> the Second ſirnamed <hi>Rufus,</hi> from his red face: <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt got
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116025:29"/>the name of <hi>Cordelion,</hi> from his inexpugnable and Lion like heart: even ſo this famous Prince whoſe life we now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, was ſirnamed <hi>Ironſide,</hi> from his notable courage and ſtrength of body, to endure all ſuch pains as is requiſite for a Souldier: not ſo called, as ſome would have it, for that he uſed to go alwayes in armour. He was third ſon to <hi>Ethelred,</hi> commonly called the unready, the eldeſt living at his Fathers death; his two Brothers dying in defence of their Countrey, made way for him to ſucceed in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: which notwithſtanding was with much oppoſition, as well of Forreigners, as his natural Subjects; ſo that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited his Fathers troubles as well as his Crown, and might be ſaid to be a King without a Kingdome. The moſt part of the Clergy, and many of the Nobility out of hatred to the Father, rejected the Son; and at <hi>Southampton</hi> choſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> for their King: this <hi>Canutus</hi> was King of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who for ſix and thirty years together had miſerably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Engliſh Nation, turning all into ruine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came; Churches and Monaſteries were made ſubject to his deſolations, and Church-men and Monks felt his cruel and mercileſs doings; Wife, Daughter, and Maid, theſe cruel <hi>Danes</hi> abuſed at their pleaſures; yea, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the chaſte Nuns to their filthy pollutions: inſomuch that ſome of them to ſave their chaſtities deſtroyed their beauties, deforming their bodies to keep their ſouls pure. To redreſſe theſe enormities, <hi>Edmund</hi> (like another <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabeus</hi>) ſtood up for his Countrey; and being Crowned at <hi>Kingſtone</hi> by <hi>Levingus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to <hi>London</hi> being then beſieged by <hi>Canutus;</hi> where he ſoon forced the <hi>Danes</hi> to raiſe their ſiege, and winter themſelves in the Iſle of <hi>Sheepie.</hi> But the Spring come, they ſuddainly aſſailed the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> and were as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly themſelves encountred by <hi>Edmund,</hi> who with great courage, though with a ſmall Army, gave them Battel at <hi>Penham</hi> in <hi>Dorcetſhire,</hi> where many of theſe deſtroyers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116025:30"/>were themſelves deſtroyed; the reſt for fafety flying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Salisbury. Edmund</hi> having recruited and refreſhed his Army, haſted after them, and at <hi>Sheorſtan</hi> in <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire</hi> a ſecond Battel was fought, where <hi>Edmund</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf moſt gallantly, executing the office both of a hardy Souldier, and valiant Commander; and undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Danes</hi> had received a great overthrow, had not Duke <hi>Edrick</hi> (who for his many treaſons was ſirnamed the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor) cut off the head of a Souldier reſembling <hi>Edmond,</hi> and holding it aloft, thus cryed to the Engliſh: <hi>Fly ye wretches, fly, and get away, for your King is ſlain; behold here is his Head:</hi> but <hi>Edmond</hi> hearing of this treacherous ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, haſted to ſhow himſelf to his Souldiers, whoſe ſight ſo revived their drooping ſpirits; that had not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching night prevented them, they had obtained that day a moſt glorious victory. Duke <hi>Edricks</hi> life had paid for his treaſon, had he not preſently fled to the enemy, who afterwards excuſing the fact (as being miſtaken in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the man, as he was willing to ſave the lives of the Engliſh) he was afterwards received into favour again. There were ſlain on both ſides by the report of writers no fewer then 20000 Souldiers, which may very well be true conſidering the Battel laſted two whole dayes; and that of <hi>Canutus</hi> ſide were many Engliſh who fought with a moſt furious and deſperate hatred to the <hi>Danes:</hi> ſo true is that expreſſion of the Poets:
<q>
                     <l>The higheſt fury raigns in civil War,</l>
                     <l>And Countrey men in fight moſt cruel are.</l>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> by ſtealth breaking up their camp, in the night time haſted towards <hi>London,</hi> which City they earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired to conquer, and where their ſhips lay in manner of a ſiege; but <hi>Edmonds</hi> coming forced them to diſcamne, who entred the City in a triumphant manner; and two dayes after gave them Battel at <hi>Brentford,</hi> where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in paſſing the <hi>Thameſis</hi> he loſt many of his men,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116025:30"/>yet obtained he the victory, and forced them to their ſhips. But as if the fable of <hi>Hydra</hi> had been turned to a verity, though they were ſuppreſſed in one place, yet with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrength they encreaſed in another; and though <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in perſon obtained many a Victory, yet by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects diſloyalty, and Duke <hi>Edricks</hi> treachery, what he got in one place he loſt in another; ſo that ſometimes he, and ſometimes <hi>Canutus</hi> were reputed as alternate Kings, as the fate of War was either with or againſt them; as a Poet writes of the ſucceſſes of thoſe times.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> altogether minding miſchief, and to make havock of all whereſoever they came, whilſt <hi>Edmond</hi> was retired into the Weſt, with great booties and ſpoils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their ſhips; and ſailing up the river of <hi>Medway,</hi> pitched their tent near <hi>Oteford</hi> in <hi>Kent.

This Victory might have put a Period to the Wars, had not Duke <hi>Edrick</hi> diſſwaded <hi>Edmond</hi> from purſuing after them, alledging the danger of ambuſh, and

In this bloody Battel the flower of the Engliſh Nobility loſt their lives, as Duke <hi>Alfred,</hi> Duke <hi>Goodwyn,</hi> Duke <hi>Athelward,</hi> Duke <hi>Athelwyn,</hi> Earl <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rchill, Cadnoth,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln, Wolſey</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ramſey,</hi> with many other of the Clergy, who coming thither to pray for the preſervation of the King and his Army, were by the <hi>Danes</hi> inhumanely but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chered: the remembrace of which battel is retained to this day by certain ſmall hills there remaining; whence have been digged the Bones of men, Armour, and the Water-chains of Horſe-bridles. <hi>Holinſhead</hi> reports that in his time there were of theſe hills to the number of ſeven or eight, now onely three remaineth at a place called <hi>Bartlow,</hi> which from them is called <hi>Bartlow</hi> Hills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edmund</hi> thus diſcomfited, went almoſt alone on foot to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> where he raiſed new forces to oppoſe his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Canutus</hi> purſuing him, both Armies met at <hi>Derehurſt</hi> near unto the River <hi>Severne,</hi> where being ready to imbrue their hands in one anothers bloods, a certain Captain ſtepped forth, and ſtanding up in ſuch a place as he might be heard of both the Generals, boldly uttered his minde in theſe or the like words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have already (worthy Chieftains) fought long enough one againſt another, and too much blood hath been ſpilt for the Soveraignty of this Land; the valours of both Generals and Souldiers ſufficiently tryed; Fortune her ſelf not knowing whom to yield the palm of Victory unto: for if one Battel
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116025:31"/>were wonne it was not long kept; nor the loſer ſo weakned but that he had both courage and power to win the next. Thus to gain you airy Titles the common Soldiers loſe their lives. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Chieftains, 'tis now high time to ſet a period to theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; let him that would wear the Diadem bear the hazard himſelf, and either try the fortune of a ſingle combat, who ſhall command, and who obey; or divide betwixt them the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which may ſuffice two, that hath formerly maintained ſeven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words were no ſooner ended; but both Generals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to try it out by ſingle combat in ſight of both Armies, they entred into a ſmall Iſland called <hi>Alney,</hi> adjoyning unto the City of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> where firſt on horſe-back, and after on foot, they encountred each other with invincible courage: but <hi>Canutus</hi> having received a dangerous wound, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Ironſide</hi> overmatched him in ſtrength, deſired a comprimiſe; and to that end thus ſpake to <hi>Edmond</hi> with an audible voice: <q rend="inline">What neceſſity thus ſhould move us, moſt renowned Prince, that for the obtaining of an airy title we ſhould ſtill put our lives into danger; better it were to lay armour and malice aſide, and condeſcend to ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable agreement: let us therefore now become ſworn brothers, and divide the Kingdom between us, and that in ſuch a league of amity, that each may uſe the others part as his own.</q> 
                  <hi>Edmond</hi> condeſcending to <hi>Canutus</hi> motion, they unbuckled their Armours, and embraced each other; and on a firme agreement afterwards divided the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome betwixt them: <hi>Edmond</hi> enjoying that part that lay coaſted upon <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi> entred upon the reſt.</p>
               <p>But long enjoyed not the <hi>Ironſide</hi> his part, for Duke <hi>Edrick</hi> a very compound of treaſons, contrived the end of renowned <hi>Edmond;</hi> who being retired to a place for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures neceſſity, he thruſt from under the draught a ſharp ſpear into his body: and having thus murthered him, he cut off his head, preſenting it to <hi>Canutus,</hi> with this fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116025:32"/>ſalutation. <hi>All hail thou now ſole Monarch of</hi> England, <hi>for here behold the head of thy Co-partner, which for thy ſake I have adventured to cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canutus,</hi> though ambitious enough of Soveraignty, yet abhorring in his heart ſo deteſtable a murther, and knowing that he who was faithleſs to his natural Sovereign, would never be faithful to him a Stranger; commanded his head to be divided from his ſhoulders, and placed upon the higheſt Gate in <hi>London.</hi> Thus we ſee how Duke <hi>Edrick</hi> was miſtaken in his hopes, who for his treaſon expecting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, received the merit due to treaſon: a worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Canutus</hi> for ſucceeding Monarchs to imitate, and in the Traytor <hi>Edrick</hi> for all falſe Subjects to beware.</p>
               <p>Thus this famous worthy, made his <hi>exit</hi> off of the ſtage of this world, having raigned in all but the ſpace of ſeven moneths; ſo that if we conſider the ſhortneſs of his time, we may wonder at the greatneſs of his actions, who had not onely to deal with forreign forces, but with falſe friends; who whilſt he lived was the onely prop to uphold the totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring eſtate of his Countrey, and whoſe death was the cauſe his Countrey-men were forced to bow their necks to a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>He left behinde him two Sons, named <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> and two Daughters, named <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Margret;</hi> which <hi>Margret</hi> was married to <hi>Malcolme Canmore</hi> King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> from which Princely bed, <hi>James</hi> the firſt, late Monarch of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> was lineally deſcended.</p>

               <p>AS my learned Authors writes, to whom I am ſo much beholding for this Narrative: to give you his own words, diſcourſing of Peace, None, ſaith he, but ſuch as are of turbulent ſpirits, or ignorant what War is, love to play the beaſts, and inhumanely gore each other. Men were not made to act Tragedies, and to make the world a ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for humane ſlaughters <hi>Nulla ſalus bello, pacem te poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus omnes.</hi> This perhaps it was made the Poet <hi>Tibullus</hi> exclaim againſt the inventers of mankindes deſtruction.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He was ſon to King <hi>Ethelred</hi> by his wife Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> and born at <hi>Iſlip</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxford;</hi> his mother (when the variable ſucceſs of War doubtfully depended betwixt <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi>) ſent him over into <hi>Normandy</hi> to Duke <hi>Richard</hi> her Brother, there to be ſecured from all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtical ſtirs; where he remained all the time of <hi>Canutus</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:116025:33"/>raign; who although he married his Mother, yet thought it more ſafe to be there then in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canutus</hi> dying, his ſon <hi>Harold</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Hare-foot,</hi> whom he had by a Concubine a ſhoemakers daughter, uſurped the Crown; but knowing others had better right to the ſame then himſelf, he reſolved to remove thoſe rubs out of his way; yet not daring to act his intentions openly, he thought to compaſs that by treachery, which he could not by force: to this end he counterfeits a letter in Queen <hi>Emma's</hi> name, unto her ſons <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Alfred,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate them to attempt the recovering of the Crown, the tenure of which letter we have inſerted as followeth.</p>

                  <hi>Emma tantum nomina Regina, filiis Edwardo &amp; Alfrido, materna impertit ſalutamina,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               <q>
                  <hi>Emma</hi> in name onely Queen, to <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Alfred,</hi> her ſons, ſendeth motherly greetings: whilſt we ſeverally bewail the death of our Soveraign, my Lord and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your ſelves (dear ſons) ſtill more and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed from the Kingdom your lawful inheritance; I greatly marvel what you determine to do, ſith you know, that the delay of attempts gives the Uſurper more leaſure to lay his foundation, and more ſafety to ſet thereon his intended buildings; never ceaſing to poſt from Town to Town, and from City to City, to make the Lords and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of them his friends, by threats, prayers, or rewards: but notwithſtanding his policy, they privately ſignifie that they had rather have one of you their Natives ſhould reign over them, then this Daniſh uſurper. Wherefore my advice is that either of you with all ſpeed repair unto me, that we may adviſe together what is beſt to be done in this ſo great an enterpriſe: fail not therefore but ſend me word by this meſſenger what you intend to do herein; and ſo fare ye well. Your affectionate Mother <hi>Emma.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The bait thus laid to catch theſe two Princes was gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſwallowed by <hi>Alfred</hi> the youngeſt, who though the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116025:33"/>laſt born, had not the leaſt hopes to wear the Engliſh Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem; and making <hi>Baldwine</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> his, and ſome few Bullogners, increaſing his Fleet, he took the Seas for <hi>England;</hi> where for his welcome he was betrayed by Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> under the notion of friendſhip; and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of King <hi>Harold</hi> inhumanely murthered: but <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> whether miſtruſting the plot, or rather liking a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life with ſafety, then a publick with danger, tarried behinde, and ſo eſcaped thoſe miſeries that <hi>Alfred</hi> encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. But as it is commonly ſeen, that a ſinful life is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a ſudden death, ſo King <hi>Harolds</hi> ſweet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning had a ſowre end; dying miſerably after he had raigned four years, and ſome few moneths; his ſpeedy death cutting off the infamy of a longer life: in whoſe room ſucceeded his brother in law, <hi>Hardi-Canute,</hi> the ſon of Queen <hi>Emma</hi> by <hi>Canutus</hi> her laſt husband; who though little differing from the other in conditions, yet is better reported of by Writers of that age, becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly entertained his half brother <hi>Edward,</hi> and made Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> purge himſelf for the death of Prince <hi>Alfred;</hi> ſo that we may in part wonder at former writers, that they ſhould conclude Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> to be guilty of that murther, and yet report he cleared himſelf of the ſame to <hi>Hardi-Canute:</hi> but his oath, ſay ſome, was the lighter urged, and the eaſier believed, by reaſon he had not long before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the king moſt bountiful gifts, namely a ſhip, whoſe ſterne was of Gold, with fourſcore Soldiers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in placed, all uniformly and richly ſuited; on each of their arms were two bracelets of Gold, with gilt Burgonets on their heads, and on their bodies a triple gilt Habergion, a Sword with gilt Hilts guirded to their waſtes, a Battel Ax on their left ſhoulders, a Target with gilt Boſſes borne in their left hands, and a Dart in the right.</p>
               <p>The King now wholly following his pleaſures, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſay more truly, his vices delighting in nothing but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116025:34"/>ſwilling and Epicuriſme; he ſoon received the reward of his intemperance, for being at <hi>Lambeth</hi> at the celebration of a Marriage, revelling and carouſing, in the midſt of his Cups he ſuddenly fell down dead with the Pot in his hand, after he had reigned two years, and was buried at <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> His death was ſo welcome unto his Subjects, that they annually celebrated the day of his death with open paſtimes in the ſtreets, which cuſtom continued even to theſe our times; being called <hi>Hoctide,</hi> or <hi>Huckstide,</hi> ſignifying a time of ſcorning or contempt. The Daniſh Line now clean extinguiſhed, (for <hi>Hardi-Canute</hi> left no iſſue behinde him) the glory of the Saxons, which had long lay buried in their own aſhes, began again to revive and flouriſh; for the Engliſh Lords weary of the inſulting Tyranny of the Danes, and willing one of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſhould rule, with a general conſent choſe Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> for their King; who being at that preſent with Duke <hi>William</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> they ſent Ambaſſadors unto him to ſignifie his Election: and that he might be aſcertained their intentions were real, they delivered him Pledges for his more aſſurance. <hi>Edward</hi> accepting (as indeed who would deny) ſo honourable an offer, with ſome few Normans repaired into <hi>Englad,</hi> where he was entertained of the people with ſuch acclamations of joy, as might well gain credence of their hearty affections towards him.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he did after his Coronation, was his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the yearly Tribute of forty thouſand pounds, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the name of <hi>Danegilt,</hi> impoſed by his Father; and for forty years together paid out of all mens Lands, except onely the Clergies, who were exempted from the ſame; <hi>Becauſe the Kings repoſed more confidence in the Prayers of the Holy Church, then in the power of Armies.</hi> It is reported the Kings clemency was moved to this compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on this following occaſion; When the Collectors of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116025:34"/>this money had gotten a great quantity of the ſame toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they brought it into his chamber, and laid it all on one heap; the King being called to ſee this great heap of Treaſure, was at the firſt ſight thereof much afraid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting he ſaw the Devil dancing upon the ſame with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great joy: whereupon he commanded it ſhould be reſtored again to the former owners, and releaſed his Subjects of that Tribute for ever. Many ſuch like ſtories are of this King related, and perhaps more then with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of truth may be either believed or delivered; which we ſhall the rather overpaſs, becauſe that in ſtories of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they are leſs to be blamed for omitting two verities, then relating one falſhood.</p>
               <p>Divers Laws being then uſed in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Mercians, Weſt Saxons, Danes, and Northumbrians) their multiplicity cauſing much confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he extracted from them all the chiefeſt and beſt, and made of them one univerſal and common Law through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land; being in a manner the fountain of thoſe which at this day we tearm the Common Laws, though the forms of pleading, and proceſs therein, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brought in by King <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour.</p>
               <p>His Wife was named <hi>Editha,</hi> the vertuous Daughter of an infamous Father, Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> a Lady incomparable for Beauty and Vertue, in whoſe Breaſt was a School of all Liberal Sciences (ſaith <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmeſbury.</hi>) Her honourable qualifications might have expiated to her Husband King <hi>Edward;</hi> her Fathers former treachery to his Brother.</p>

               <p>This Lady though accompliſhed with theſe endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of minde and body, the King notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained her bed, committing thereby the offence forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. Or if at any time he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her his bed, it was no otherwiſe then <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Abiſhag;</hi> for ſo much he himſelf on his death-bed did declare, ſaying, <hi>That openly ſhe was his Wife, but in ſecret embracings as his own Siſter:</hi> But whether it were for his debellity of body, or love to Virginity, I determine not; certain it is he was content to hear her accuſed of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency; whereof if ſhe were guilty, he could not be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: nor can this his chaſtity, though applauded by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, be accounted otherwiſe then an injury, and too ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical a trial of his Wives Vertues.</p>
               <p>The King having no iſſue of his own, and deſirous to eſtabliſh the Crown in the Engliſh blood, ſent into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> for his Nephew <hi>Edward,</hi> the Son of <hi>Edmund Ironſide,</hi> who by reaſon of his long abſence out of <hi>England,</hi> was commonly called by the name of the Out-law; who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over, brought with him his Wife <hi>Agatha,</hi> and <hi>Edgar, Margret,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> his Children, in hope of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but his hopes with himſelf ſoon diſſolved into duſt, for he lived but a while after: ſo that <hi>Edward</hi> thereby was diſappointed of his intentions, which was to have made him his Succeſſour in the Crown; whereupon without delay he pronounced <hi>Edgar</hi> the Out-laws Son, and his great Nephew, Heir to the Crown, and gave him to ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name <hi>Adeling,</hi> a name appropriated to Princes of the blood, which were born in hope and poſſibility of the Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:116025:35"/>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Edward</hi> was thus buſied about ſettling a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, <hi>Euſtace</hi> Earl of <hi>Bulloigne</hi> who had married his Siſter <hi>Goda,</hi> came over into <hi>England</hi> to viſit him; and returning homeward, at <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Harbinger dealing roughly with a Burgeſs for Lodgings cauſed his own death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he in revenge killed the ſaid Burgeſs with eighteen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citizens: the Canterburians herewith incenſed, in a great rage armed themſelves, killed twenty of his retinue, and forc'd the Earl himſelf to flight; who returning back again to the King, exhibited grievous complaints againſt the Townſmen; whereupon Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> was commanded to ſee execution done upon the offenders: but he not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting the Earl, was not overhaſty to execute his commiſſion, but adviſed the King to examine the matter further, before he proceeded againſt his true Subjects at the inſtigation of Strangers; this Counſel though it gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the love of the Commons, procured the hatred of moſt of the Nobility; who ſo incenſed the King with his refuſal, that a day of meeting was appointed at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> wherein Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> ſhould anſwer his contempt.</p>
               <p>The day come and the eſtates aſſembled, Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> was ſent for, but refuſed to appear, alledging his preſent ſervice againſt the Welſh then ready to enter into Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; but they by Ambaſſadours clearing themſelves, the ſuſpicions encreaſed, and great preparation for War was made on both ſides. To the aid of the King came <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter, Siward</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Rodulf</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford</hi> with competent forces; to <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> repaired his people of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> his two ſons <hi>Harold</hi> and <hi>Swain,</hi> bringing with them the men of <hi>Eſſex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, Huntington, Somerſet, Oxford, Hereford, Glouceſter,</hi> and <hi>Barkſhires;</hi> ſo that his Army exceeding the Kings, made him ſo much exceed in pride, as to demand <hi>Euſtace</hi> Earl of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> with all his French and Normans, to be delivered unto him; which being (as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116025:36"/>good reaſon was) denyed, each ſide prepared themſelves to battel; but through the advice of ſome then preſent, the matter was ended without blood-ſhed and referred to a Parliament to be holden at <hi>London;</hi> ſo that now both ſides ſeemed to be indifferently well pacified; but under theſe aſhes of diſſimulation lay hidden burning coals of fire, and revenge burſt out into a flame; for <hi>Edward</hi> with a ſtrong guard entred <hi>London,</hi> and Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> with his ſons in warlike manner came into <hi>Southwark</hi> to his own houſe, where his great army ſoon diſſolyed into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; his Souldiers for the moſt part returning home again: which when <hi>Edward</hi> underſtood, he preſently pronounced ſentence of baniſhment upon him and his five ſons, without further proceeding by way of Parliament. And that his wife, who was daughter to Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> ſhould have her ſad ſhare in the afflictions of her Parents &amp; brethren who were baniſhed the realm; he committed her Priſoner to the Monaſtery of <hi>Wilton,</hi> attended onely with one maid: an unjuſt act, unbefitting a King, to puniſh the Child for the Fathers offences, contrary to the preſcript Rule of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye: the Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of the Father, neither ſhall the father bear the iniquity of the ſon.</hi> Yea, it was the obſervation of a Heathen man, <hi>It is meer injuſtice, if the father be a Rebell, that the ſon ſhould therefore be accounted a Traytour.</hi> Yet as the Poet hath it,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Yet notwithſtanding we ſee oftentimes</l>
                  <l>Children are puniſh'd for their fathers crimes.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But as things violent are not long permanent, ſo this ſtorm of diſſention betwixt King <hi>Edward</hi> and Earl <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> was ſoon blown over; for the Nobles interceding for him unto the King, a reconciliation was made, and Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> reſtored to his former Dignities; but though the King forgave him his Treaſons, the King of kings forgot not his Perjury: for he falſely ſwearing himſelf to be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116025:36"/>clear of Prince <hi>Alfreds</hi> death; and wiſhing if he were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he might never ſwallow down one morſel of bread, God himſelf manifeſted the truth, and according to his wiſh (though not his deſire) it happened unto him. A fearful example to all foreſworn wretches of Gods heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their perjury.</p>
               <p>Another Act of this Kings was touching his Mother, which proclaimed him, if not undutiful, yet very unnatural; he was troubled with an infirmity, his ears were alwayes opened to the complaints of ſtrangers, and their mouths alwayes full with complaints againſt the Engliſh: <hi>Robert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a Norman by birth, accuſed Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> that under colour of private devotions, ſhe had over familiarly accompanied with <hi>Alwine</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> The King crediting the Archbiſhops words, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her (to wipe off this imputation) to paſs the triall of fire Ordeal, which was by paſſing bare-footed, and blinde-folded over nine Plow-ſhares, glowing red hot, and laid at unequal diſtance; which ſhe did without any hurt, to the great aſtoniſhment of all the beholders: in memory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe gave nine Mannors to the Minſter of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the Plow-ſhares ſhe had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in her trial: And <hi>Edward</hi> repenting the wrong he had done her, beſtowed on the ſame place the Iſland of <hi>Portland</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> being about ſeven miles in compaſs: for ſo the chance in thoſe dayes was ſet, that whoſoever loſt, the Monks ever won.</p>
               <p>Several ſuperſtitious Writers render this King in his life to be of that holineſs, that he received power from heaven to cure many diſeaſes; amongſt others the ſwelling of the throat, commonly called the Kings-Evil; a prerogative that continued hereditary to his Succeſſours Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which, as they affirm, was firſt derived from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alluridus Rivallenſis</hi> writing the life and death of this King, reporteth him to be a man void of pride, a lover of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116025:37"/>peace, a contemner of covetouſneſs, abhorring wars and blood-ſhed; inſomuch, as when he lived as a baniſhed man in <hi>Normandy,</hi> he would oftentimes ſay, <hi>That he had rather live a private life for ever, then to attain the Kingdom by the death of any man.</hi> Indeed he was more fitting to be ruled then to rule, being too much ſubject to his Subjects, his familiarity cauſing their contempt; accounting his humility to be meer ſimplicity, though otherwiſe adjudged by the Poet.</p>

               <p>His innocent and harmleſs Government continued his Reign in length twenty three years, ſix moneths, and odd dayes; he died, and was buried in the Church at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> which he formerly had builded, being after his death canonized for a Saint.</p>

                  <hi>WIlliam</hi> the Firſt, ſirnamed the Conquerour, was baſe ſon to <hi>Robert</hi> the firſt of that name, the ſixth Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> begotten on <hi>Arlet</hi> a Skinners Daughter: (from whence our Engliſh word Harlot is thought to be derived) when he was about ſeven years old, his Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> aſſembled all his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles together, and cauſed them to ſwear fealty to this his ſon <hi>William,</hi> committing him to the governance of two of his Brothers, and the defence of that Government to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the French King; a ſtrange confidence in the Duke, to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116025:37"/>commit the tuition of his ſon that was baſe born, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders that were legitimate, and a potent Monarch, who deſired to reannex that Dukedom to his Crown; but the proximity of blood in his brothers, and his former ſervices to the French King made him ſo confident, that in the eighth year of his Dukedom he ſets forward on his voyage; where entring <hi>Jewry,</hi> and not able to travel, he was born in a Litter on Saracens ſhoulders; and near unto the City meeting a returning Pilgrim, deſired him to report in his Countrey, that he was carried to heaven upon the devils back; but ſo far he went, that he never returned, leaving his ſon a ball to be toſt about in Fortunes Tennis-Court. Firſt, one <hi>Roger de Treſny</hi> ſought to toſs him out of his Dukedom, pretending the illegitimation of <hi>William;</hi> which fair pretence got him many complices, but the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence raiſed him up friends, particularly <hi>Roger de Beamont,</hi> by whoſe valour this <hi>Roger de Treſny</hi> was defeated and ſlain.

               <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> having thus vanquiſhed his enemies, and now grown more potent then he was before; (for every rebellion when it is ſuppreſſed makes the Prince ſtronger, and the Subjects weaker) comes over into <hi>England</hi> to viſit his Couſen King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, to whom (it is ſaid) <hi>Edward</hi> (with the conſents of <hi>Stigandus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Earls <hi>Goodwin</hi> and <hi>Syward,</hi> and of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116025:38"/>
                  <hi>Harold</hi> ſon to Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi>) promiſed (if he dyed without iſſue) to leave the Crown; which promiſe was afterward ratified by the corporall oath of <hi>Harold;</hi> who being at his mannor of <hi>Boſeham</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> one day for his recreation in a fiſhers boat launched forth to the Sea; but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winde was driven upon the Coaſts of <hi>Ponthieu</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where being taken by Earl <hi>Guido,</hi> was preſented to Duke <hi>William,</hi> to whom he ſolemnly ſwore to aſſiſt him for obtaining the Kingdom: but <hi>Edward</hi> dying, the ſplendour of his Crown ſo dazeled the eyes of <hi>Harold,</hi> that forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his former promiſe and oath, he ſet the ſame upon his own head. Duke <hi>William</hi> whoſe hopes were that <hi>England</hi> ſhould be his, now ſeeing his hopes fruſtrated by <hi>Harold,</hi> prepares his forces againſt the perjured King, with whom joyned many of the French Nobility; and to make their endeavours the more ſucceſsfull, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond ſent him a conſecrated Banner, an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and one of the hairs of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle. Thus furniſhed on all ſides, with a Navy of 896. Ships, he cuts the briney face of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and arrives at <hi>Pemſey</hi> near <hi>Haſteings</hi> in <hi>Suſſex;</hi> from whence he ſent a Monk on Ambaſſage to <hi>Harold,</hi> (who was newly returned from the ſlaughter of the <hi>Norwegians</hi>) offering him three conditions; the firſt was, that he ſhould reſigne up the Crown, or hold it as a Tributary Prince under him; or elſe in ſight of both armies to defend his Title in Perſon againſt the Duke; if not, to ſtand to the arbitrement of the Pope: but <hi>Harold</hi> inſtead of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his requeſts, threatens his ruine, except he forthwith returns into <hi>Normandy.</hi> Both ſides thus enraged, (the one ſeeking to get, the other to keep, that which by right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to another) ſeven miles from <hi>Haſteings</hi> a bloody battel was fought, wherein was ſlain of the Engliſh, if I may credit my Author 66654. King <hi>Harold</hi> himſelf manfully fighting was likewiſe ſlain; a Prince, (had he attained the Crown by right) worthy to have injoyed it a longer time,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116025:38"/>but his pride and ambition cauſed his deſtruction; ſo true is that which one obſerves.</p>

And now the better to ſecure himſelf in his new ſtate, he endeavours to get into his poſſeſſion the ſtrongeſt forts in the Kingdom; and to this end takes his journey towards <hi>Dover,</hi> (the Lock and Key of the Kingdome as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> calls it) that by the command of ſo ſtrong a place, he might the more eaſily keep under the Natives, and keep out ſtrangers, if any excited by his example ſhould dare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt what he had done. But the Kentiſh-men having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his intentions, aſſembled together; and at <hi>Swanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe</hi> two miles from <hi>Graveſend,</hi> met him in the forme of a moving Wood; for ſeeing no way lay open ſave onely a front, they agreed to carry in their hands great Branches of Trees, which not onely kept them from being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but induced him to think all the Woods thereabout of the like nature; ſo that he willingly conſented to what they deſired, which was the continuance of their former Laws, and Pledges being given on both parts for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, <hi>Kent</hi> yieldeth up her Earldome and Caſtle of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> to King <hi>William.</hi>

               <p>But to leave the City, and return unto the Court, new troubles in <hi>Normandy</hi> ariſing in King <hi>Williams</hi> abſence, he was forced ſuddenly to raiſe an Army to ſuppreſs them, carrying along with him thoſe whom he moſt ſuſpected might take the advantage of his troubles abroad, ſo as to raiſe any new broils at home, pretending their aid againſt his Rebells in <hi>Normandy;</hi> but indeed fearing in his abſence they ſhould raiſe a new rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> dealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as the politique Captain <hi>Sextorius</hi> did with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, whoſe children he kept under pretence of learning them the Latine Tongue, but indeed as Hoſtages for their Fathers loyalties. And becauſe the common people are to be feared for their number, as well as the Nobility for their greatneſſe, he diſarmed them; that ſo being left naked, they might be uncapable of Inſurrections: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his policy, no ſooner was he gone, but <hi>Edrick Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaticus</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:116025:40"/>(a man of great ſpirit and power) aided by the Welſh-men made great ſpoils in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> waſting all to the mouth of <hi>Wye.</hi> Theſe troubles made the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſo diſtaſteful to King <hi>William,</hi> that returning out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> he laid ſuch heavy Taxes and Impoſitions upon them, that many of them preferring penurious liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fetters of gold, left their habitations, and lived as Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws in the woods and deſerts. The chiefeſt of theſe Male-contents were <hi>Edwyn</hi> and <hi>Morcar,</hi> (the two ſtout Earls of <hi>Yorkshire</hi> and <hi>Cheſter</hi>) <hi>Hereward, Goſpatria,</hi> and <hi>Syward,</hi> with many other Lords, to whom joyned <hi>Stigand</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> Archbiſhops, with many of the Clergy; who having <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> amongſt them, endeavoured to recover that which for want of taking time by the foretop they had improvidently loſt. But their Forces being diſſipated by <hi>Williams</hi> conquering ſword, every one ſought how to ſave himſelf by flight; ſome fled into <hi>Denmtrk,</hi> others into <hi>Hungary,</hi> moſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> whileſt <hi>William</hi> with triumph returned to <hi>London;</hi> from whence he ſent Ambaſſadours to <hi>Malcolme Canmore,</hi> then King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Edgar</hi> with the reſt of his enemies; which if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, he would denounce open War againſt <hi>Scotland.</hi> But King <hi>Malcolme</hi> not onely denied his requeſt, but alſo took to Wife the Lady <hi>Margret,</hi> ſiſter unto <hi>Edgar,</hi> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned bloody Wars on both ſides; and four ſeveral Armies were ſent againſt the Scots. The firſt under the conduct of one <hi>Roger</hi> a Norman, who entering haſtily into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> was by the Scots diſcomfited, and himſelf by his own Souldiers treacherouſly ſlain: to ſecond whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings another Army was ſent under the Command of <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whoſe fortunes being not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Williams</hi> expectations. A third Army was ſent, led by <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent;</hi> but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more uſed to the Church then the Camp, and fitter to handle a pen then a ſword, encountering with the Scots,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116025:40"/>upon the firſt onſet was quite defeated: but King <hi>William</hi> nothing diſcouraged with theſe overthrows, ſent his ſon <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> with a far greater power then he ſent before; which notwithſtanding did no far greater ſervice then the fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> at length a Peace was concluded betwixt them, which though prejudicial to King <hi>Williams</hi> ſide, yet as affairs then ſtood, he could not well have acted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: which was, that King <hi>Malcolme</hi> ſhould enjoy that part of <hi>Northumberland</hi> which lieth betwixt <hi>Tweed, Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and <hi>Stanemore,</hi> doing homage to the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for the ſame.</p>
               <p>By this Peace was <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> and thoſe other male-contented Lords reſtored to the Kings favour; for <hi>William,</hi> although a Martial Prince, ſought to eſtabliſh his Crown rather by Peace then by the Sword, which made him the more apt to forget former injuries. And no doubt but this his too much lenity was one principle cauſe of his continual troubles; for <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morcar</hi> (the two ſtout Earls mentioned before) combining with <hi>Fretherick</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Albanes,</hi> fell into a new conſpiracy, ſetting up <hi>Edgar Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> once again their Generall. <hi>William</hi> ſtorming at theſe diſloyal attempts, with a mighty power haſtneth againſt them, who deſperately bent to maintain what they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, reſolved to make the Sword their Judge: but King <hi>William</hi> loath to loſe that with ſhame which he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the effuſion of ſo much blood, prevailed ſo far with them, that an Aſſembly was appointed to meet at <hi>Berkham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> where he ſolemnly ſware upon the Holy Evangeliſts, and the Reliques of St. <hi>Albane</hi> the Martyr, inviolably to obſerve the Ancient Laws of this Land, eſpecially thoſe compiled by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, which ſo wrought him into their good opinions, that they all forthwith laid down their weapons.</p>
               <p>But the ſtorme being paſt, the danger was ſoon forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and theſe mountains promiſes proved but molehill
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:116025:41"/>performances; for notwithſtanding his oath, he dealt more roughly with the Engliſh now then before, thruſting ſome into Exile, and depriving others of their Lands, which he beſtowed upon his <hi>Normans,</hi> whoſe Charters were of a far other tenour, forme, and brevity, then thoſe tedious and perplexed Conveyances, ſince in uſe, as may appear by this one, taken out of on old Chronicle in the Library at <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>

               <p>Nor need we wonder the King was ſo liberal to the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince he himſelf loved hunting ſo well, that to maintain his game he depopulated above 30. miles in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> where had been (ſaith <hi>Carton</hi>) twenty ſix Towns, and eighty Religious Houſes: ſo that where before God was Worſhipped, now wilde Beaſts grazed; a ſin which God puniſhed in his poſterity, his two ſons <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> and his grandchilde <hi>Richard</hi> ſon to Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there to untimely ends; which place was then and is to this day called by the name of the New Forreſt.</p>

               <p>Towards the concluſion of his reign, diſſentions betwixt <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> and him, drew him once more over into <hi>Normandy;</hi> where falling ſick, and keeping his bed more then he uſed to do, the French King hearing that his diſeaſe was in his belly, ſcoffingly ſaid, <hi>Our Couſin</hi> William <hi>is laid now in Childe-bed: Oh! what a number of Candles muſt I offer at his going to Church? ſurely I think a hundred thouſand will not ſuffice.</hi> This French frump being told to King <hi>William;</hi> he made this anſwer, <hi>Well, our Couſin of</hi> France <hi>I truſt ſhall be at no ſuch coſt: but after this my Child-birth, at my going to Church, I will finde him one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Candles, and light them my ſelf.</hi> And accordingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, he enters <hi>France</hi> with a mighty Army, ſpoiling all the Weſt parts thereof before him.

               <head>The Life of THOMAS BECKET, Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Becket</hi> was the Son of one <hi>Gilbert Becket,</hi> a Perſon of good Alliance and Riches; who in his youth travelling to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as he returned, was taken priſoner by a Saracen Admiral, with whom he remained a year and a half; during which time the onely Daughter of the Admiral was ſo taken with his carriage and qualities, that (he having by flight obtained his liberty) ſhe wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his love, abandoned her Fathers Houſe and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and followed him ſecretly into <hi>England;</hi> where being inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion, and baptized in the Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity in the preſence of ſix Prelates, ſhe was married to the aforeſaid <hi>Gilbert;</hi> of whom he had Iſſue this <hi>Thomas,</hi> whoſe Life we now relate; who (as his Legend recites) was firſt brought up in a Religious Houſe of <hi>Merton,</hi> afterwards was inſtructed in the Liberal Sciences, and then ſent to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris;</hi> from whence returning home, he was by <hi>Theobald</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> made his Archdeacon, a place in thoſe dayes of high degree in the Engliſh Cleargy, next unto Lord Abbots and Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Much about that time <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Normandy</hi> ſucceeded King <hi>Stephen</hi> in the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who in the very firſt year of his Reign advanced <hi>Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> to be Lord Chancellour of <hi>England;</hi> in which high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he carried himſelf like another King. His retinue was great; his Followers men of good account; his Houſe keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as might compare with, if not ſurpaſs, the greateſt Earls of the Kingdom; his Clothes very coſtly full of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; his Furniture mighty rich; his very Bridles of beaten
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116025:43"/>ſilver. Yea, Fortune did ſeem to have made him her Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and all things ſo flowed according to his deſire, that one would have judged him to have laid clean aſide the very thought of a Clergy-man.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> having Wars in <hi>France,</hi> he ſerved him with a Band of 700. Souldiers of his own Family, beſides many others, with which, and ſome additional Forces after the Kings departure he obtained a great victory. At another time he himſelf in perſon unhorſſed a Frenchman called <hi>Enguerranus de Creya,</hi> a moſt hardy Souldier, renowned for deeds of Arms and Chevalry; for theſe valiant acts, in reward, and in further hope of his faithful ſervice, upon the death of <hi>Theobald,</hi> the King made him Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> though the Monks objected againſt him, that neither a Courtier, nor a Soundier (as he was both) were fit to ſucceed in ſo high and ſacred a Function: But <hi>Thomas</hi> having obtained this dignity, forgot the King who had raiſed him to the ſame. For as the Poet hath it;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>A ſwelling ſpirit hates him by whom he climes,</l>
                  <l>As Ivy kills the tree whereon it twines:</l>
                  <l>So riſing men, when they are mounted high,</l>
                  <l>Spurn at the means that firſt they mounted by.</l>
               </q>
               <p>For not long after began that great controverſie between <hi>Regnum &amp; Sacerdotium,</hi> the Crown and the Mytre; the occaſion whereof was, the King being credibly informed, that ſome Clergy-men had committed above an hundred murthers under his Reign, would have them tried and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in his Temporal Courts, as Lay-men were, but this (as being contrary to the priviledges of the Church) the Archbiſhop withſtood: This affront of a ſubject the King could not endure, finding himſelf hereby to be but a demy-King. Wherefore having drawn to his ſide moſt of the Biſhops, in an Aſſembly at <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> he propoundeth theſe Articles, peremptorily urging <hi>Becket</hi> to aſſent to them. 1. That none ſhould appeal to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:116025:43"/>any cauſe whatſoever without the Kings licence. 2. That it ſhould not be lawful for any Archbiſhop or Biſhop to depart the Realm, and repair to the Pope, upon his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, without licence from the King. 3. That it ſhould not be lawfull for any Biſhop to excommunite any perſon that holdeth in <hi>Capite</hi> of the King, without licence of the King, nor grant any interdict againſt his Lands, nor the Lands of any his officers. 4. That it ſhould not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any Biſhop to puniſh perjured nor falſe witneſſes. 5. That Clarks crimonous ſhould be tried before ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judges. 6. That the King and his ſecular Juſtices, ſhould be Judges in matters of Tythes, and other like cauſes Eccleſiaſtical. There points ſo nearly touched the Papal Sovereignty, that <hi>Becket</hi> reſolutely denied to ſigne them: but by the importunity of many Lords and Prelates, at laſt he yields, ſubſcribes the Ordinance, and ſets his hand unto it. The King hereupon ſuppoſing all contradiction ended, and that <hi>Thomas</hi> would not waver in his faith, called an aſſembly of the States at <hi>Clarendon</hi> in <hi>VViltſhire,</hi> to collect and enact theſe Laws; where <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Oxenford</hi> ſitting Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, <hi>Becket</hi> relapſed, ſaying, He had grievouſly ſinned in that he had done, and that he would not ſin therein any more. The King herewith vehemently incenſed, threatens baniſhment and deſtruction to him and his; whereupon <hi>Becket</hi> once again perſwaded, ſwears <hi>in verbo Sacerdotali,</hi> in the word of a Prieſt, ſincerely, that he would obſerve the Laws, which the King entituled, <hi>Avitae;</hi> and all the Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, and whole Clergy, with all the Earls, Barons, and Nobility, did promiſe and ſwear the ſame faithfully and truly to obſerve and performe, to the King, and to his Heirs for ever. But the King deſiring him to affix his ſeal to an Inſtrument, wherein thoſe Laws (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſixteen) were contained; he refuſed, ſaying, He did promiſe it onely to do the King ſome honour, <hi>verbo tenus,</hi> in word onely. Nor could the example of his fellow Biſhops,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116025:44"/>nor the perſwaſions of <hi>Rotrod</hi> the Popes meſſenger, move him at all to compoſe theſe differences.</p>
               <p>It may be thought a fable, yet is related by divers ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Authors, that one time during this contention, certain fellows cut off the Archbiſhops horſes tail; after which fact, all their children were born with Tails like Horſes; and that this continued long in their Poſterity. For may own part, though I confeſs God is able to do this, and much more; yet I reckon this amongſt other ridiculous miracles mentioned of him by thoſe writers, as that of <hi>Ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardus,</hi> who for ſtealing a great whetſtone (which the Author that writes it beſt deſerved) being deprived of his eyes and virilities, by ſentence of Law; upon prayer to Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> he had all reſtored again. Yea, even a Bird having been taught to ſpeak, flying out of her cage, and ready to be ſeized on by a Sparrow Hawk, ſaid onely, <hi>St. Thomas help me,</hi> and her enemy fell preſently dead, and ſhe eſcaped.</p>
               <p>But ſlighting theſe follies, to return to our Hiſtory, the King ſummoning a Parliament at <hi>Northhampton, Becket</hi> was cited to appear before his Majeſty: which he refuſing, upon his contempt, the Peers and Prelates judged his goods confiſcated to the Kings mercy. He making his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the Parliament demanded of him an account of 30000 pounds which he received when he was Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour to which he anſwered, that when he was choſen to be Archbiſhop, he was by the Kings authority freed and acquitted of all Debts and Obligations of Court and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and ſo delivered over to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that therefore at that time he would not anſwer as a Lay-man, having before had a ſufficient diſcharge. This anſwer of the Archbiſhop was like Oyl caſt on fire, which inſtead of quenching increaſt the Kings anger; and the Prelates perceiving the Kings diſpleaſure to tend yet to ſome further ſeverity, premoniſhed him to ſubmit himſelf, for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116025:44"/>that otherwiſe the Kings Court intended to adjudge him a perjured perſon, and alſo a traytor, for not yielding tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Allegiance to his temporal Sovereign, as himſelf had ſworn to do: and accordingly the Prelates themſelves by joynt conſent adjudged him of perjury; and by the mouth of the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> diſclaimed thence forward all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto him as their Archbiſhop. But <hi>Becket</hi> herewith nothing daunted, cauſed to be ſung before him the next day at the Altar that Pſalm, <hi>Principes fedent. The Princes ſit and ſpeak againſt me, and the ungodly perſecute me,</hi> &amp;c. and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with taking his Silver Croſier in his own hands, enters arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith into the Kings Prefence; who more and more enraged at <hi>Beckets</hi> inſolency, commandeth his Peers to ſit in judgement on him as on a traytor: and the Courtiers like Ecchoes anſwering the King; the whole Court ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but Treaſon: ſo that <hi>Becket</hi> afraid of being ſlain, haſteth home; and changing his coſtly Robes into courſe Rags, paſſeth over into <hi>Flanders,</hi> calling himſelf by the name of <hi>Dereman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop gone, the King baniſhes all his Kindred out of his Dominions; and he on the other ſide excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates all ſuch as had to do againſt him: at length the King of <hi>France</hi> with intreaty, and the Pope with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Churches cenſures, made a full atonement and reconciliation between them; the Archbiſhop in great triumph returned to <hi>England,</hi> having been abſent from his native Countrey for the ſpace of ſeven years.</p>
               <p>All controverſies ſeemed now fully to be ended, though the ſequel thereof proved far otherwiſe; for ſome excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Biſhops and other men of great account, deſiring to be abſolved, he refuſed to do it, unleſs with this cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they ſhould ſtand to the judgement of the Church in thoſe things for which they were excommunicated: but they diſdaining the pride of the Archbiſhop, poſte over into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where the King was then, informing him, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116025:45"/>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> was now grown more haughty then before, that he went up and down with great Troops of men, both Horſe and Foot, that attended on him as upon the Kings own Royal Perſon; that to be a King indeed he wanted but the name, and ſetting the Crown upon his head. The King herewith highly incenſed, in a great rage ſaid, <hi>And is it poſſible that I cannot peaceably enjoy neither Kingdom. Dignity, nor Life; and all this for one onely prieſt? Curſed be all ſuch as eat my bread, ſince none will revenge me of this fellow.</hi> Theſe words being over-heard by four Knights. Sir <hi>Morvil.</hi> Sir <hi>William Tracy,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Brito,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Fitz-urſe,</hi> they thinking to do the King a pleaſure, (though as the ſequel of his reign proved, they could not have done him a greater injury) haſted into <hi>England,</hi> and in his own Church of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> moſt barbarouſly murthered him, being then about 48. years of age; not long after he was Canonized by Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the day of his death, being the 29. of <hi>December,</hi> kept annually holy. Many miracles are report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been done by him, and his Shrine ſo inriched by Pilgrims, which from all places came thither in devotion; that at the defacing thereof in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the ſpoil thereof in Gold, and Precious Stones filled two great Cheſts, ſuch as ſix or eight ſtrong men could do no more then convey one of them at once out of the Church. Thus the Images of many men were richly clothed, when many poor Chriſtians (Gods Image) went almoſt naked; ſo full of charity were thoſe empty times of knowledge; a ſhame to us, who know more but practice leſs.</p>

               <p>THis reign, as it in part epitomizes the Hiſtory of the holy War, without being guilty of an omiſſion of the moſt admired part of Chronical Hiſtory, I could not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt; who for his inexpugnable and Lion-like heart, obtained the ſirname of <hi>Coeur de Lion:</hi> he was a moſt valiant and magnanimous Prince, accuſtomed to Wars; he died in the fields of <hi>Mars,</hi> of whom as a Prince we ſhall ſay nothing, having ſo much to relate of him after he came to be King. This martial Prince, born in a martial age, was third ſon to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and ſucceeded him in the Crown after his Deceaſe, his elder Brothers dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before their Father. At his Coronation he commanded no Jews ſhould be preſent: but they deſirous to ſee the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, haſted thither in great numbers; but the price of their lives paid for the pleaſure of their eyes; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people falling upon them and ſlaying a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: ſo ominous to the enemies of Chriſt was the firſt day of this Kings reign, preſaging, ſaith one, his following ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes in the Jewiſh Countreys.</p>
               <p>For intending a journey to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (not as a Pilgrim to ſee the City, but as a Souldier to conquer the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) he raiſes an Army of thirty thouſand Foot, and five thouſand Horſe; his next care was for money (the ſinews
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:116025:46"/>of War) and notwithſtanding his Father had left him eleven hundred thouſand pound, (a vaſt ſum for that age) yet was it no thought ſufficient for ſo great a journey. Therefore to the end he might be able to go thorow with his work, he ſells the Caſtles of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Roxborough</hi> to the Scottiſh King for ten thouſand pounds, the Priory of <hi>Coventry</hi> to <hi>Hugh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> for 300. marks, and the County of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to <hi>Hugh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſme</hi> for his Life, jeaſting he had made a new Earl of an old Biſhop; then feigning he had loſt his old Seal, he made a new one; proclaiming that whoſoever would ſafely enjoy thoſe things which before time they had enrolled, ſhould come to the new Seal; by which princely skill (not to ſay cheat) he ſqueezed much money out of his Subjects purſes.</p>
               <p>Having proceeded thus far towards his journey, his next care was for ſecuring the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. On his Brother <hi>John</hi> (whom he knew to be of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſpirit, and apt to take fire on the leaſt occaſion) on him he heaped both riches and honour, that by his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality he might win him to loyalty: but the chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Land he committed to <hi>William Longchamp</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> chuſing him for his Viceroy rather then any lay-Earl; becauſe a Coronet perchance may ſwell into a Crown, but never a Mitre: with him was joyned in Commiſſion, <hi>Hugh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> for the parts of <hi>England</hi> beyond <hi>Humber.</hi> Yet, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports of the Conſulſhip of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Bibulus;</hi> that nothing was reported of <hi>Bibulus,</hi> but all of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> ſo <hi>Longchamps</hi> Sun ecclipſed <hi>Durhams</hi> Candle, his great Bell making ſuch a ſound, that the other Tantony could not be heard.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſettled his affairs in <hi>England,</hi> he croſſeth the Sea to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to go along with him in this journey; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſtay (occaſioned by the death of the French Queen)
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116025:46"/>they agreed on theſe Chriſtian and friendly terms. 1. <hi>That each of them preſerve the others honour, and bear faith to him for life, and member; and earthly dignity,</hi> 2. <hi>That neither of them ſhall fail the other in their Affairs; but that the King of</hi> France <hi>ſhall help the King of</hi> England <hi>to defend his Land, even as he would defend the City of</hi> Paris <hi>if it were beſieged; and</hi> Richard <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>ſhall help the King of</hi> France <hi>to defend his Land, even as he would defend his City</hi> Roan <hi>if it were beſieged.</hi> Theſe Articles agreed on, and ſworn to on both ſides theſe two great Monarchs of the Weſt, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>France,</hi> ſet forwards on their journey; in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which, give me leave to light my Candle at Mr. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> fire, and to borrow ſome of his expreſſions to inrich my ſtile; who in his Hiſtory of the holy War hath ſo elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſcribed it: nor let me be accuſed for a fellon, or a counterfeit, in mixing his Gold amongſt my Alchymy, ſince it may well paſs for pay, which is ſtamped with ſo currant language.</p>
               <p>There attended King <hi>Richard</hi> in this journey <hi>Baldwine</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Hubert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Ralph de Glanvile</hi> late Chief Juſtice of <hi>England, Richard de Clare, Walter de Kime,</hi> &amp;c. At <hi>Tours</hi> he took his Pilgrims Scrip and Staff from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop; his Staff at the ſame time caſually brake in pieces; which ſome conſtrued a token of ill ſucceſs. Likewiſe when he and the French King with their trains paſſed over the Bridge at <hi>Lyons,</hi> (which brake by reaſon of the throng of people) on the fall of the Bride this conceit was built, that there would be a falling out betwixt theſe two Kings, which accordingly happened: their intercourſe and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity breeding hatred and diſcontent betwixt them.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Lyons</hi> theſe two Kings parted company, <hi>Philip</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over the <hi>Alps</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> to the Sea-ſide to <hi>Marſeillis,</hi> to meet with his Navy; which being by tempeſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116025:47"/>driven to other parts, after ſix weeks ſtay, he hireth ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for himſelf and his company; and paſſing forwards, upon occaſion, anchored in the Mouth of the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> within fifteen miles of the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was ſo hot on his journey, his devotion was ſo cold towards his Holineſs, that he would not vouchſafe to give him a viſit, but plainly told <hi>Octavian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ostia</hi> the Popes Confeſſor; that having better objects to beſtow his eyes upon, he would not ſtir a ſtep to ſee the Pope; laying to his charge many ſhamefull matters, touching the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Simony and Covetouſneſs, with many other reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, alledging that they took 700. marks for conſecration of the Biſhop of <hi>Mains</hi> 1500. marks for the Legative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely;</hi> and of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> an infinite ſum of money; whereupon he refuſed to ſee <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding this his diſobedience to his ſpiritual Father, he arived ſafe as <hi>Meſſana,</hi> where he met with the French King his moſt Chriſtian brother; and although he loſt the Popes, yet found he the Almighties Bleſſing; his Navy within few dayes after ariving ſafe in <hi>Cicily.</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116025:47"/>thouſand ounces of Gold, purchaſing that with his purſe, which by uſing juſtice he might have had for nothing,</p>
               <p>King <hi>Phillip</hi> ſeemed nothing pleaſed at theſe diſſentions, yet wiſely covered the fire of his anger with the aſhes of diſcretion, till ſuch time he might ſhow it with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and thinking to foreſtall the market of Honour, and take up all for himſelf, he haſted preſently to <hi>Ptolemais:</hi> which the Chriſtians had long beſieged, and with them he joyns, while King <hi>Richard</hi> taking his Siſter <hi>Joan,</hi> and <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia</hi> daughter to <hi>Sanctius</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> in 190.

               </p>
               <p>Long time had this City been beſieged by the Chriſtians, and many were the miſeries that were underwent by both ſides; the Famine raging within, and the Peſtilence reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without: ſo that now upon King <hi>Richard</hi> arival, the Turks deſpairing of ſuccour, and their victualls wholly ſpent; they yielded up the City on condition to be guarded out of it ſafely. To take poſſeſſion for the French, there was ſent in <hi>Drogou de Merlou,</hi> and an 100. men at arms, and for the Engliſh <hi>Hugo de Gurnay</hi> with the like number; who equally parted the City, Goods, and People between them.</p>
               <p>Here the Engliſh caſt down the Enſigns of <hi>Leopoldus</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:116025:48"/>Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which he had advanced in a principal place of the Wall, and threw them into the Jakes; for which injury King <hi>Richard</hi> paid dearly afterwards; ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is to exaſperate any though far inferiour: for as the fable acquaints us, the Beetle may anoy the Eagle, and the Mouſe befriend the Lion:</p>
               <p>Eighteen dayes after the taking of <hi>Ptolemais</hi> the French King returned home, leaving <hi>Odo</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Army in his abſence, pretending the air of the Countrey did not agree with his body; but more likely that the air of King <hi>Richards</hi> too great honour could not down with his too great minde. <hi>Hoveden</hi> reports he was bribed by <hi>Saladine;</hi> which if true, let him for ever forfeit the ſirname of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the ſtile of the moſt Chriſtian Prince.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> goes on notwithſtanding the French Kings departure, and fortifies the Town of <hi>Joppa;</hi> where going one day a hawking to recreate himſelf, being weary laid himſelf down upon the ground to fleep, when ſuddenly certain Turks came upon him to take him; but he awakened with their noiſe, riſeth up, gets a horſeback, and drawing out his ſword, aſſaults the Turks; who feigning to fly, drew the King into an ambuſh where many Turks lay; who had certainly taken him if they had known his perſon: but one of the Kings Servants called <hi>William de Patrellis,</hi> crying out in the Saracen Tongue, that he was the King, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently lay hold upon him, and let the King eſcape.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan</hi> was poſſeſt of the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and with it of the right of the Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> more greedy of honour then profit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeth his Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> with this hungry Prince, for his Kingdome of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and upon this title the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were ſtiled Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And now did King <hi>Richard</hi> long to be poſſeſt of his merchandiſe, whereupon it was determined then ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently march towards the holy City. <hi>Richard</hi> led the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116025:48"/>of his Engliſh, Duke <hi>Odo</hi> commanded in the main battel over his French, <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Avergne</hi> brought on the Flemings and Brabanters in the rear; <hi>Saladine,</hi> Serpent-like, biting the heal, aſſaulted the rear, not far from <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> when the French and Engliſh wheeling about, charged the Turks moſt furiouſly: emulation, formerly poyſon, was here a cordial; each Chriſtian nation ſtriving not onely to conqer their enemies, but to overcome their friends in the honour of the Conqueſt. King <hi>Richard</hi> ſeeking to put his courage out of doubt, brought his judgement into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being more prodigal of his perſon then beſeemed a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. A great Victory they obtained of the Turks, with little loſs to themſelves, ſave onely of <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Avergne,</hi> who here died in the Bed of Honour.</p>
               <p>And now they marched up within ſight of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where King <hi>Richard</hi> intercepted the Caravan of the <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> laden with many rich Eaſtern wares, containing much in a little, and guarded with ten thouſand men; whom King <hi>Richard</hi> valiantly encountring, with 5000. ſelected Souldiers, put moſt of them to the Sword, and took three thouſand Camels and four thouſand Horſes and Mules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all their rich treaſure; and yet of all this, and all that he gained in <hi>Cicily</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he brought home nothing but one Gold Ring, all the reſt of his wealth melting away in this hot ſervice.</p>
               <p>And now King <hi>Richard</hi> being advertiſed of the King of <hi>France</hi> his invading <hi>Normandy,</hi> contrary to his oath at his departure, inforced him, though much to his grief, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace with <hi>Saladine,</hi> and that upon conditions not very honourable for the Chriſtians; which was to demoliſh all places they had walled ſince the taking of <hi>Ptolemais;</hi> which was in effect to undo what with much charge they had done: but ſuch was the tyranny of King <hi>Richards</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, forcing him to return, that he was glad to embrace thoſe conditions he hated at his heart; and ſo ſending his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116025:49"/>Wife <hi>Berengaria,</hi> and his Siſter <hi>Joan,</hi> with a great part of his Army into <hi>Cicily;</hi> and from thence into <hi>England,</hi> he paſſeth himſelf with ſome few of his company by the way of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and on the Coaſts of <hi>Iſtria</hi> ſuffered ſhipwrack: wherefore he intended to pierce thorow <hi>Germany</hi> by land, the next way home.</p>
               <p>The better to paſs undiſcovered, he diſguiſes himſelf to be one <hi>Hugo</hi> a Merchant, whoſe onely merchandiſe was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but in his journey near to <hi>Vienna</hi> was unhappily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the profuſeneſs of his expences: ſo that the very policy of an Hoaſteſs finding his Purſe ſo far above his Cloaths did detect him. <hi>Leopoldus</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof, as being Lord of the Soyl, ſeized on this royal <hi>Hero,</hi> meaning now to ge his pennyworths out of him, for the affront done unto him in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> But this booty being too great for a Duke, the Emperour got him into his Cuſtody, meaning to coyn much Gold and Silver out of his moſt unjuſt affliction, by ſharp impriſonment. Yet all the weight of their cruelty did not bow him beneath a Princely carriage.</p>
               <p>Fifteen moneths impriſonment did he endure, at laſt he was ranſomed for an hundred and forty thouſand marks, <hi>Collen</hi> weight, and delivered to his Mother Queen <hi>Elianor,</hi> by the Archbiſhops of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Collen;</hi> which laſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Archbiſhop for joy of his deliverance, did celebrate divine ſervice after this manner; <hi>Deus miſſit angelum. Now I know that God hath ſent his Angel, and hath delivered thee out of the hand of</hi> Herod, <hi>and from the expectation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We muſt not here forget how Gods judgements over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this Duke, puniſhing his Dominions with Fire, Water, Barrenneſs, Worms, and Peſtilence. The Fire cauſually burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Towns; the River of <hi>Danubius</hi> drowning then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his Subjects in an overflow: the Earth waxing dry and ſear, the Worms deſtroying ſuch Fruit and Grain as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116025:49"/>grew, and the ſtroak of Peſtilence killing the principal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Gentlemen of his Dominions. The Duke himſelf in a tilting for ſolemnity of his Birth-day, fell off his horſe, and broke his leg; which turning to a Gangreen, he cut off with his own hands, and died thereof.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> after his return into <hi>England,</hi> at the Abby of Saint <hi>Edmunds,</hi> offered up the rich Imperial Standard of <hi>Curſac</hi> Emperour of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which he took among the ſpoils of the <hi>Griffons</hi> Camp, and then marched to reduce ſuch Caſtles as the ſervants of his Brother <hi>John</hi> held againſt him; who ambitiouſly and ungratefully during his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abſence, ſought to wreſt the helme of Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands, fortifying the Caſtles of <hi>Marleborough, Lancaſter,</hi> St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Mount, <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Tichil, Henry de Pumeray</hi> Captain of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Mount, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for certain that King <hi>Richard</hi> was come, died for very fear, and the reſt of the Caſtles were reduced with ſome ſmall reſiſtance. And now to ſhow that he was an abſolute King again, he cauſed himſelf to be again Crowned at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter;</hi> the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> honouring the ſolemnity with his preſence, who bare a Sword before King <hi>Richard:</hi> between which two Princes there followed great amity and tenderneſs of love all their dayes.</p>
               <p>Not long after this the King being at dinner at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> received advertiſement that the French had laid Siege to <hi>Vernoul,</hi> a ſtrong Town of his in <hi>Normandy;</hi> with which he was ſo moved that he ſwore a great oath, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver turn his head till he had confronted the French. For the performance of which oath, he cauſed the wall-right before him to be preſently beaten down, that ſo he might paſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without turning his face, never reſting till with an hundred great Ships he had croſt the Seas from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> into <hi>Normandy.</hi> But King <hi>Richard</hi> made not ſo much haſte to ſuccour, but the French King made as much haſte to be gone; here Earl <hi>John</hi> ſubmits himſelf to his Brother, who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:116025:50"/>upon his ſubmiſſion reſtores his poſſeſſions unto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely, <hi>I wiſh you may as well remember your fault, as I ſhall forget it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> following the French King, overtakes him at <hi>Vendome,</hi> who affrighted at his approach, the ſecond time flies without ſtriking a ſtroak, leaving behinde him all his bag and baggage, Munition, Tents, and Treaſure, to a marvellous value; together with the Indentures of ſuch as had left King <hi>Richard,</hi> to ſerve King <hi>Philip.</hi> Much about that time one <hi>Philip</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bevois,</hi> a Martial man, and who much annoyed the Engliſh borders, was fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately taken in a Skirmiſh by King <hi>Richards</hi> ſide, who put him in priſon; the Biſhop hereupon complained to the Pope, who wrote in the behalf of his ſon, as an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſon, and a Shepherd of the Lords. The King ſent unto the Pope the Armour he was taken in, and engraved thereon the words which <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons uſed when they ſold their Brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and preſented their Father with his Coat. <hi>Vide utrum filii tui tunica ſit, vel non. See whether it be thy Sons Coat or no.</hi> Whereupon the Pope replyed, <hi>That he was neither his Son, nor the Son of the Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be ranſomed at the Kings will, becauſe he was rather judged to be a Servitor of Mars then a Souldier of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now come to the laſt act of this Kings Life, which drew the black cloud of death over this triumphal and bright ſhining ſtar of Chevalry; one <hi>Widomare</hi> Vicount of <hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> having found a great hord of Gold and Silver, ſent part thereof to King <hi>Richard</hi> as chief Lord: but he over co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous would not be contented without all, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that treaſure was wholly his by vertue of his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royal. Thereupon marches with a great power to a Caſtle of the Vicounts called <hi>Chaluz,</hi> where he ſuppoſed the riches were; the Garriſon of which place offered to yield the ſame, and all therein, if onely their lives and limbs might be ſaved: but he would not accept of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116025:50"/>bidding them defend themſelves as they could, for he would enter by the Sword, and hang them all; but in the aſſault he was ſlain by a ſhot from an Arbaliſt; the uſe of which warlike engine he firſt ſhewed unto the French. Whereupon a French Poet made theſe verſes in the perſon of <hi>Atropos.</hi>

                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Third ſirnamed of <hi>Windſor</hi> (his Birth-place) was eldeſt ſon to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second; who for ſome miſgovernments during the time of his Reign was by the factious Nobility depoſed from the Crown, and not long after deprived of his life by the procurement (as it is ſaid) of his Wife Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and ſome others, and young <hi>Edward</hi> Crowned King, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1327. Who though he thus riſe by Fathers ruine, yet may in ſome ſort be excuſed of the ſame. Firſt, in regard of his adoleſcency, for though he were then married, yet had he not attained to 15. years of age, nor could he be induced to accept of the Crown until he was certified by ſome of his Lords that his Father had voluntary reſigned it unto him; beſides the exemplary puniſhment he took on the Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> a chief actor in his Fathers Tragedy, may in part aſſure as of his Innocency therein.

               <p>Theſe treaſons of the Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> together with his exceſſive pride, and over much familiarity with the Queen-Mother, made him ſo diſtaſteful unto the Lords, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> thus prevented in his deſign by the French King, inſtitutes the moſt honourable order of the Garter; the Original caſe whereof is dubious: ſome conjecture that it aroſe for that in a Battel wherein he was victorious, he gave the word Garter for the word or ſign. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſaith, King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third founded this order, to adorn Martial vertue with honours, rewards, and ſplendour. The Original Book of the Inſtitution deduces the invention from King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, and that King <hi>Edward</hi> adorned it, and brought it into ſplendour; but the common received opinion is, that a Garter of his own Queen, or (as ſome ſay) of <hi>Joan</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> ſlipping off in a Dance,

Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. The third and laſt Battel was commanded by the King: himſelf, having in it 700. men at Arms, and 3000. Archers. The French Army was far greater, conſiſting of ſixſcore thouſand men, having in it the two Kings of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> and <hi>Majorica,</hi> and of Princes, Dukes, Earls, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and Gentlemen bearing Arms about 3000.

               <p>The French King not able to raiſe the Siege, ſeeks to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him by an invaſion in <hi>England.

               <p>This loſs of the Scots loſt the French King the Town of <hi>Callis,</hi> which after eleven moneths Siege was delivered up to King <hi>Edward,</hi> who made Governour of the ſame, one <hi>Aymery</hi> of <hi>Pavia,</hi> and then with his Queen returned into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Black Prince, ſo named of this dreaded acts, and not from his complexion, was the eldeſt ſon of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; a Prince of an undaunted ſpirit, ſo full of vertues, that he left no room for any nnworthy vice, who, had he lived in the heroick times, might well have been num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt the nine Worthies. At 15. years of age his father takes him over with him into <hi>France,</hi> to initiate him as it were in the School of War, as one of our modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets hath it.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>In this fair heaven of magnanimity,</l>
                  <l>The Prince, the ſtar of honour decks the fly,</l>
                  <l>Fixt here ſo ſoon by's Fathers band, who meant</l>
                  <l>He there ſhould fall, or gild that firmament.</l>
               </q>
               <p>I will for the more brevity treat onely of three ſpecial paſſages in this Princes life; his Battel at <hi>Creſcy,</hi> his Victory at <hi>Poityers,</hi> and his reſtoring <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to his Crown of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> in the Battel at <hi>Creſcy</hi> the French exceeded the Engliſh nigh four for one; and by reaſon of their numbers, being confident of Victory, would needs haſten the Fates to their own deſtruciton, and enforcd the Engliſh to make their paſſage through, as they then determined, the red Sea of their own blood; nor could the terrible peals of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from heaven, nor ſhoals of Ravens and ravenous birds, which came flying over their Hoaſt, foreſhewing the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of carcaſſes at hand, hinder their proceedings; but as if aſcertained of victory they did erect their banner called <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame,</hi> as a ſigne of taking none to mercy, no more then fire is extinguiſht by Oyl: againſt which the Engliſh advance their Banner of the red Dragon, to ſignifie no mercy to them that would ſhew none.</p>
               <p>Both Armies divided into three Battalions, the ſign of Battel being given by King <hi>Philip,</hi> the horrour of War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhow its ſelf; the graſs was ſoon changed from green to red, and their gliſtering faucheons to a purple colour, Drums and Trumpets ſounded, the knells of death, horrour,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:116025:58"/>and deſtruction appeared every where. Amongſt other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that aſſiſted the French in this ſad War; were twelve thouſand <hi>Genowayes,</hi> being all of them Groſs-bow men; theſe were to open a way for the French horſe with their ſhot: but at the very inſtant fell ſuch a ſhowr of rain, which for the preſent wet the Archers ſtrings, and made them leſs ſerviceable. The French King hereupon commanded Count <hi>Alanſon</hi> who commanded the Van, to beat them from the point, and to charge the Engliſh: this was no ſooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded then performed, and the poor Genowayes trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down by the horſe; who now turn their fury againſt the French, ſeeking to deſtroy whom they came to help. The Engliſh enemies unto either having reinforced their Archery, liberally beſtow their arrows amongſt them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the deſtruction of them both; who ever ſaw a Matachin dance imitate fighting, might here ſee a fight imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Matachin dance. The French way thus paved with <hi>Genoan</hi> bodies, half out of breath with headlong haſte, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtay till they came up to the Engliſh Battel, with whom encounters the noble Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who commanded the Engliſh Voward that day; the fight grew fierce and cruel, each ſide ſtriving to exceed the other in valour. Who had ſeen the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> at that preſent, would have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Pythagoras</hi> doctrine of Tranſmigration, that the ſoul of great <hi>Hector</hi> had been infuſed into him: what Poets have feigned of ancient <hi>Heroes,</hi> fell ſhort of the truth of what he performed that day. The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (whom age might have taught to have expected death in his Chamber, and not to have ſought him in the Fields of <hi>Mars</hi>) ſeals his love to the French ſide with his deareſt blood; his troop of faithful followers with their ſlaughtered bodies covering him even in death; whoſe plume of Oſtrige feathers won then by valiant <hi>Edward,</hi> hath every ſince been the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the Princes of <hi>Wales.</hi> Another trophey of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Chevalry was the King of <hi>Majorca,</hi> who in aid of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:116025:59"/>French was there likewiſe ſlain, as a renowned Poet in his deſcription of that victory.</p>

                  <l>Leave two uncrown'd to Crown one victory.</l>
               </q>
               <p>It was now high time for King <hi>Philip</hi> to bring up the main Battel, whoſe numbers threatned the deſtruction of the Engliſh; this onſet threatning ſo much danger, King <hi>Edward</hi> is ſent for to come up with his power to aid the Prince; whoſe anſwer was, <hi>Let them ſend no more to me for any adventure that may befall, whileſt my ſon is alive; but let him either vanquiſh or bravely dye, becauſe the honour of this brave day ſhall be his, if God ſuffer him to ſurvive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwer would have wrought deſpair in cowards, but to theſe valiant <hi>Heroes</hi> brought increaſe of courage, who now beſtir themſelves more then before, ſending ſuch numbers to griſly <hi>Charon,</hi> that his leaking boat was ready to ſink under the preſſure of their numerous weight. Twice was King <hi>Philip</hi> beat off his horſe, and twice by the Lord <hi>Beaumont</hi> mounted again; but being wounded in the Neck and Thigh, was forced to retire himſelf out of the fight; upon whoſe departure the French gave way, and ſtaid not long but betook them to flight. The French King with a ſmall company flies to <hi>Bray,</hi> and being queſtioned by the guard who he was, anſwered, <hi>The Fortune of France;</hi> whereupon being known, he was received into the Town, with the tears and lamentations of the people. The number of the ſlain are reported to be 30000. (the ſame number which King <hi>Edward</hi> brought to the Battel) the chief whereof were, the two Kings of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Majorca, Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Alanſon, John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon, Ralph</hi> Earl of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, Lewis</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Dolphin of <hi>Viennois,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Sancerr, Harecourt, Aumarl, Nevers, &amp;c.</hi> Thus under the conduct of this valiant Prince, the Engliſh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a glorious victory, whom King <hi>Edward</hi> the Father thus congratulates, <hi>Son, God ſend you good perſeverance to ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:116025:59"/>proſperous beginnings; you have nobly acquit your ſelf, and are well worthy to have the governance of a Kingdom entruſted unto you for your valour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wars greateſt tempeſt now blown over, ſome little miſts remained behinde, like to the gleanings after harveſt, certain troops of French, under the command of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> and the Prior of <hi>France</hi> (ignorant of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened) were coming from <hi>Abbevile, Roan,</hi> and ſome other Towns thereabouts, to the aid of King <hi>Philip,</hi> and to enrich themſelves by the ſpoil of the Engliſh: but that they might be ſenſible of the ill fortune of a bad market, they found King <hi>Philip</hi> diſcomfitted before they came, and they themſelves muſt become the Engliſh ſpoil.</p>
               <p>From his victory at <hi>Creſcy,</hi> I ſhall proceed to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt at <hi>Poytiers,</hi> as I have already intimated in the Life of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> dying, his ſon <hi>John</hi> ſucceeds him, who inveſts his Son <hi>Charles</hi> with the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Aquitain.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> beſtows the ſame on the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> commanding him to defend that right with his Sword; hence grows the quarrel, and a ſmall matter, will cauſe a great difference where both parties wait for an occaſion. The Prince with an Army lands is <hi>Aquitain,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering all where ever he comes, unto whom Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixth ſends a meſſenger with an overture to intercede for a Peace: the Prince returns anſwer, that the meſſage muſt be ſent to the King his Father, for he could not meddle without command from him. Mean while he takes Cities and Towns at his pleaſure; and without impeachment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> where for that year he takes leave of Martial Atchievements.</p>
               <p>The prince could not continue long without action, for no ſooner had the Son rid through his Winters ſtage, but with an uncontrouled march he advances through <hi>Bruges, Perigort,</hi> and <hi>Limoſin,</hi> intending to return to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> through the Countries of <hi>Turain, Paictou.</hi> and <hi>Saintcin.</hi> But
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116025:60"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> (haſting to go beyond his Father in misfortunes) ſeeks to intercept his paſſage; and with a mighty Army follows after, whom he overtakes about the City of <hi>Poytiers.</hi> Both Armies preparing themſelves for fight, two Cardinals from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> labour to take up the quarrel; but King <hi>John</hi> whom the Deſtinies drave head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to deſtruction, would accept of no conditions; but that the Prince ſhould deliver him four Hoſtages, and as vanquiſhed, render himſelf and his Army to his diſcretion: but this being with juſt indignation rejected, it came to a moſt bloody and fearful tryal. The French Army exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Engliſh ſix to one, by reaſon the Prince had not long before ſent a great part thereof to defend <hi>Aquitain;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he might be able to deal with the French numbers, he takes all the advantage he could of the ground, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently got the benefit of Vines, Shrubs, and Buſhes, with iron Spikes, with other incumbrances, on that part he was like to be aſſailed, to impeſter and intangle the French horſe, which he ſaw were to come furiouſly upon him: then dividing his Army into three Battalions, he committeth the vaward to the Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-ward was guided by himſelf, and the Reer-ward led by the Earls of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Suffolk.</hi> The Army thus mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled, the noble Prince ſtanding conveniently to be heard, encouraged his Souldiers with this following ſpeech as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from an ancient Manuſcript.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your manhood (moſt noble companions in Arms) hath been ſo often experimented under my Father and me, that it proves you are not degenerate from true Sons of Engliſh men, but to be deſcended from thoſe whoſe lively couragiouſneſs hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore tamed the French, the Cyprians, the Siracuſians, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labrians, and the Palaſtines; brought under the ſtiff-necked Scots, unruly Iriſh, and ſtubborn Welch; unto whom no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was painfull, no place invincible, no ground unpaſſable, no Hill (were it never ſo high) inacceſſable, no Tower un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaleable,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:116025:60"/>no Army impenetrable, no armed Souldier or whole Hoaſts formidable. At this time, gallant Countreymen, the honour, love of our Countrey, and the rich ſpoil of the French call upon us to be valiant; let not their numerous Army af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright you, ſince they are the ſame men who not long ago were vanquiſht by a handfull of us at the Battel of</hi> Creſcy. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber withall that I am</hi> Edward <hi>your Leader, who will partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate with you either in weale or in woe; either ſharing with you in the honor of their overthrow, or dying with you if overthrown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarcely could the Prince make an end of his Speech, when the French like an impetuous torrent, ſlighting the petty numbers of the Engliſh, came furiouſly on as to an aſſured victory; but upon their firſt aſſault were ſo wrapt in, moleſted, and encombred amongſt the Vines, that the Archers galled and anoyed them at their pleaſure: for the French King, to give the honour of the day to his Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, imployed them onely without his Infantry; ſo as they being diſordered and put to rout, his whole Army was ſoon utterly defeated: as <hi>Drayton</hi> deſcribes this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Here a hand ſever'd, there an ear was cropt,</l>
                  <l>Here a chap falne, and there an eye put out;</l>
                  <l>Here was an arm lopt off, there a noſe dropt,</l>
                  <l>Here half a man, and there a leſs piece fought.</l>
                  <l>Like to diſmembred ſtatues they did ſtand,</l>
                  <l>Which had been mangled by times iron hand.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Few ſuch liſts of priſoners do we meet withall in any ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as here were taken at this Battel, <hi>viz. John</hi> King of <hi>France, Philip</hi> his Son, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens, James</hi> of <hi>Burbon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Ponthieu, John</hi> of <hi>Artoyer,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eu, Charles</hi> his Brother, Earl of <hi>Longuevile, Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Tankervile, Salbruch, Naſſaw, Dampmarlin, La Roch,</hi> with many other Lords, beſides two thouſand Knights and Gentlemen; nor did the ſlain come far ſhort of the priſoners, the Chiefeſt whereof were
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116025:61"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Burbon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Athens,</hi> high Conſtable of <hi>France, John Clermont</hi> Marſhall, <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Charney</hi> Lord great Chamberlain, the Biſhop of <hi>Chalons,</hi> the Lords of <hi>Landas, Pons,</hi> and <hi>Chambly,</hi> with others, to the number of 1700. Knights and Gentlemen. The Prince having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Souldiers, needed not at that time reward them; giving them the rich plunder of the Field, which did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently recompence them for their victory. This indeed whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a Souldiers valour, when deſert is recompenſed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The Engliſh whoſe valour was moſt conſpicious, were the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Suffolk, Salisbury, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> the Lords, <hi>Cobham, Spenſer, Berkley, Baſſet,</hi> and <hi>Audley;</hi> which laſt named Lord for his valour, was rewarded by the Prince with the gift of five hundred marks Fee ſimple in <hi>England,</hi> which he preſently gave to four of his Eſquires: whereupon the Prince demanding whether he accepted not his gift? he anſwered, that theſe men had deſerved the ſame as well as himſelf, and had more need of it: with which reply the Prince was ſo well pleaſed, that he gave him five hundred marks more in the ſame kinde, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample worthy of immortal memory, where deſert in the Subject, and reward in the Prince, ſtrive which ſhould be greateſt. Nor did the Prince uſe leſs humanity towards his priſoners, whom he entertained in moſt honourable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſo that King <hi>Johns</hi> Captivity was onely reſtraint of his liberty, being attended on like a King in the hands of his enemy; for noble ſpirits ſcorn to inſult over miſery: 'tis <hi>Plebean</hi> rage that is mercileſs. Having refreſhed his Army, he marcheth with his priſoners to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> where he tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while longer to reſt his Souldiers; from thence he ſets ſail for <hi>England</hi> ariving at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> as ſoon as he had knowledge of the Victory, cauſed a general Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving all over <hi>England</hi> eight dayes together, giving God the thanks and glory, knowing him the Author, and his Son but the inſtrument of this unparallel'd victory.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:116025:61"/>
               <p>By reaſon of theſe his wonderful Atchievements, his name grew famous all the Chriſtian world over, to whom for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour comes <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> driven out of his kingdom by the French, with the aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and his Baſtard Brother <hi>Henry</hi> placed in his room. Prince <hi>Edward</hi> conſidering what a dangerous preſident this might be againſt all lawful Kings, that any one ſhould be thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned, having obtained leave of his Father, reſolveth to aid him, and taking along with him an Army of thirty thouſand men, makes his way through the ſtreights of <hi>Rouncevallux</hi> in <hi>Navarr,</hi> accompanied with the Kings of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Majorca, John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> his Brother, with many other Knights and Gentlemen. On the other ſide King <hi>Henry</hi> for defence of his Diadem had aſſembled an Army of an hundred thouſand, conſiſting of French, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Glequin</hi> their famous Captain; as alſo of <hi>Caſtilians</hi> both Chriſtians and Saracens. On the borders of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> at a place called <hi>Nazers,</hi> it came to a Battel, where the Prince obtained a glorious Victory, ſlew many thouſands of his enemies, and took above two thouſand priſoners; nor left he off here, but proceeded ſo far untill he had ſet him in <hi>Burgus</hi> upon his Throne again.</p>
               <p>The greater the benefit is of him that receives it, the more monſtruous is his ingratitude that doth not acknowledge it: this ungrateful King, notwithſtanding the benefits he had received of the Prince, diſmiſſed his without money to pay his Army, which conſtrained him in his return to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> to coin his Plate; but that not ſupplying his preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, he layes upon his Dominions in <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> a new taxation, which was the cauſe of a moſt dangerous revolt. But this was not all the miſchief that he accrewed by this journey, for the Prince brought back with him ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of body, that he was never throughly well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Some report him to have been poyſoned by King <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and probable enough he might be guilty of ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116025:62"/>whoſe whole courſe of life was ſo full of vice. Duke <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lanceſter</hi> was not freed from the ſuſpition of haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his death, though the heat of the Countrey and the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Seaſon might be the principal cauſe. How ever it was, certain it is he ſurvived not long after, dying at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> upon Trinity Sunday, <hi>Anno</hi> 1376. aged about ſix and forty years; a Prince excelling all the princes which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſurpaſſing in Martial deeds all the Heroes that have lived after him. His body was buried at Chriſt-Church in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where his monument ſtandeth, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him onely one Son, who was afterwards King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the name of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, unleſs we ſhould reckon his natural iſſue, Sir <hi>John Sounder,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Clarendon</hi> Knights, which latter is thought to be Anceſtour to the houſe of the <hi>Smiths</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

               <head>The Life of Sir JOHN HAWKWOOD.</head>
               <p>AMongſt thoſe many Worthies which this Martial age produced, that valiant Knight Sir <hi>John Hawkwood</hi> deſerveth remembrance; who though of low birth, by his Martial proweſs purchaſed his own renown over the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.</p>
               <p>He was born at <hi>Sible Heningham</hi> in the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and was in his youth bound apprentice at <hi>London</hi> with a Taylor, from whence he was preſt in the muſters for ſervice of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and ſent into <hi>France</hi> as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier; where contrary to the Proverb, which ſaith, <hi>Taylors are no men:</hi> he behaved himſelf ſo valiantly that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:116025:62"/>he was made a Captain over a Company of Foot Souldiers, and not long after upon ſome further good ſervice by him performed, advanced unto the order of Knighthood: but a peace being concluded between the French and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and his eſtate not able to maintain his Title, he was loath to return home again to follow his old occupation; it being ſomething prepoſterous from a Knight to turn Taylor again: wherefore he joyned himſelf with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies called the Late-comers, who being about five or ſix thouſand, made great ſpoil upon the Eaſt parts of <hi>France,</hi> paſſing through <hi>Champain, Burgondy,</hi> and <hi>Damphin,</hi> even to the very Gates of <hi>Avignion</hi> in <hi>Province.</hi> From thence he departed into <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> having the leading of that part of the Companies, which was called the White Band, with whom he ſerved valiantly in the Wars of <hi>John</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> but <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Son to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Third, King of <hi>England,</hi> coming over into <hi>Italy,</hi> to marry with the Lady <hi>Violanta</hi> Daughter of <hi>Galeacio,</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain,</hi> he forſook that ſervice and attended the Duke to the marriage.</p>
               <p>To omit their ſumptuous entertainment, which by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Jovius</hi> upon the life of <hi>Galeacio</hi> is written at large, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naby</hi> the Brother of <hi>Galeacio,</hi> having at that time great Wars with the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> obtained of the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> that Sir <hi>John Hawkwood,</hi> being a Captain and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal man of his retinue, might come to aid him in his Wars; for he himſelf being a warlike Prince, had a deſire to make ſome trial of the Diſcipline of the Engliſh. Sir <hi>John Hawkwood</hi> hereupon undertaketh the ſervice, behaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo valiantly in ſeveral Aſſaults and Skirmiſhes, that the Lord <hi>Barnaby</hi> for his valour importuned him to be his Son in Law, and gave him in marriage the Lady <hi>Dowager</hi> his Daughter, with the value of ten thouſand Florences of year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenue for her portion.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of this alliance his pay was encreaſed, and his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116025:63"/>name became famous all over <hi>Italy,</hi> for it was judged his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts were not ſmall, that ſo great a Prince as <hi>Barnaby</hi> would ally himſelf with him; yet notwithſtanding all this, upon ſome further hopes conceived, he revolteth from <hi>Barnaby,</hi> and joyneth himſelf with his enemy: ſo true is that of <hi>Lucan.</hi>

               <p>By reaſon of this revolt many of the Towns of <hi>Lombardy</hi> came to be waſted, by the outragious ſpoils of the Engliſh men; amongſt other they took the Towns of <hi>Faera,</hi> and <hi>Banacanallo,</hi> whereof he ſold one to the Marqueſs of Eaſt for twenty thouſand Crowns, and the other he kept. Having both his Forces and pay encreaſed, he determines to ſeek new adventures, going firſt to the aid of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the twelfth, and having with great commendation recovered the Cities of <hi>Province</hi> that had revolted from him, for his ſervice therein, was worthily rewarded with the dominion of five Towns. From him he went to the Florentine, and not long after to the Piſans; from thence to the Florentines again, under whom he ſerved with ſuch a number of our Nation, both horſe-men and foot-men, that all <hi>Italy</hi> feared him, with that ſucceſs and increaſe of his honour and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous renown, that he was reputed to be the beſt Souldier of that age; for he had learned by his long experience in the Wars, having an exceeding ripe and quick conceit to force occaſions to frame his reſolutions, and to make ſpeedy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, being alſo as the opportunity required, both hot in his fight, and notable for his delayes; in ſo much as ſundry great Captains, who were afterward highly renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, proceeded out of his School, as from an exact maſter of Martial affairs.

               <p>THis famous and learned Poet <hi>Groffery Chancer</hi> Eſquire, was ſuppoſed by <hi>Leland,</hi> to have been born in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire</hi> or <hi>Barkshire;</hi> but as it is evident by his own words he was born in the City of <hi>London,</hi> as we have it from him in his Teſtament of Love. <hi>Alſo in the City of London, that is to me ſo dear and ſwéet, in which I was forth grown; and more kindely love have I to that place then any other in yerth, as every kindely
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:116025:64"/>creature hath full appetite to that place of his kindely ingendure, and to wilne reſt and peace in that ſtede to adide) thilke peace ſhould thus there have béen bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which of all wiſe men is commended and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his Parentage, although <hi>Bale,</hi> he termeth himſelf <hi>Galfridus Chaucer nobili loco natus, &amp; ſummae ſpei juvenis,</hi> yet in the opinion of ſome Heralds (otherwiſe then his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and learning commended him) he deſcended not of any great Houſe, which they gather by his Arms; and indeed both in reſpect of the name which is French, as alſo by other conjectures it may be gathered, that his Progenitours were Strangers; but whether they were Merchants, (for that in places where they have dwelled, the Arms of the Merchants of the Staple have been ſeen in the glaſs win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows) or whether they were of other callings, it is not much neceſſary to ſearch: but wealthy no doubt they were, and of good account in the Commonwealth, who brought up their ſon in ſuch ſort, that both he was thought fit for the Court at home, and to be employed for matters of State in Forreign Countreys.</p>
               <p>His Education, as <hi>Leland</hi> writes, was in both the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as appeareth by his own words in his Book entituled, The Court of Love; and in <hi>Oxford</hi> by all likelihood in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or in <hi>Merton</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with <hi>John Wickliffe,</hi> whoſe opinions in Religion he much affected: For who ſhall read his Works, will finde him not covertly, but with full mouth to cry out againſt the vices and enormities of the Prieſts in thoſe times.

               <p>Improving his time in the Univerſity, he became a witty Logician, a ſweet Rhetorician, a grave Philoſopher, a Holy Divine, a skilful Mathematician, and a pleaſant Poet; of whom for the ſweetneſs of his Poetry may be ſaid, that which is reported of <hi>Steſichorus;</hi> and as <hi>Cethegus</hi> was tearmed <hi>Suadae Medulla,</hi> ſo may <hi>Chaucer</hi> be rightly called the pith and ſinnews of Eloquence, and the very life it ſelf of all mirth and pleaſant writing: beſides, one gift he had above other Authours; and that is, by the excellencies of his deſcriptions to poſſeſſe his Readers with a ſtronger ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of ſeeing that done before their eyes which they read, then any other that ever writ in any tongue.</p>
               <p>By his travel alſo in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he ſpent much time in his young years, but more in the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, he attained to a great perfection in all kinde of learning, as <hi>Bale</hi> and <hi>Leland</hi> report of him. <hi>Circa poſtremos Richardi ſecundi annos in Galliis floruit, magnamque illic ex aſſidua in literis exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione gloriam ſibi comparavit. Domum reverſus forum Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinenſe, &amp; Collegia Leguleiorum, qui ibidem patria jura in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretantur, frequentavit, &amp;c.</hi> About the Latter end of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Seconds dayes, he flouriſhed in <hi>France,</hi> and got himſelf into high eſteem there by his diligent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in learning. After his return home, he frequented the Court at <hi>London,</hi> and the Colledges of the Lawyers, which there interpretted the Laws of the Land; and among them he had a familiar Friend called <hi>John Gower,</hi> a <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> man born, a Knight, as <hi>Bale</hi> writeth of him. This <hi>Gower</hi> in a Book of his entituled <hi>Confeſſio Amantis,</hi> tearm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Chaucer</hi> a worthy Poet, and maketh him as it were the judge of his works.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:116025:65"/>
               <p>He married a Knights Daughter of <hi>Henault,</hi> called <hi>Paon de Ruel,</hi> King of Arms, by whom he had iſſue his Son <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> to whom King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third (in recompenſe of his Fathers ſervices in <hi>France</hi>) gave him in marriage the Daughter and Heire of Sir <hi>John Burgerſhe</hi> Knight. This <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Chaucer</hi> had onely one Daughter named <hi>Alice,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thrice, firſt to Sir <hi>John Philip</hi> Knight, then to <hi>Thomas Montacute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and the third time to <hi>William de la Pole</hi> Earl and after Duke of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> who for love of his Wife, and the convenient ſeat of her eſtate, he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Barkſhire</hi> where his Wives Lands lay.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Alice</hi> had a Daughter by her ſecond Husband <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Montacute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> named after her Mother <hi>Alice,</hi> married to <hi>Richard Nevill,</hi> Son to <hi>Ralph</hi> Earl of <hi>Weſtmerland;</hi> by whom ſhe had <hi>Richard, John,</hi> and <hi>George: Richard</hi> eſpouſed <hi>Anne,</hi> ſiſter and ſole heir to the Lord <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> and after Duke of <hi>Warwick,</hi> in whoſe right he was created Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to our ancient Poet <hi>Geffery Chaucer,</hi> he had alwayes an earneſt deſire to inrich and beautifie our Engliſh Tongue, which in thoſe dayes was very rude and barren; and this he did, following the example of <hi>Dantes</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch,</hi> who had done the ſame for the Italian Tongue; <hi>Alanus</hi> for the French, and <hi>Johannes Mena</hi> for the Spaniſh: neither was <hi>Chaucer</hi> inferiour to any of them in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance hereof; and <hi>England</hi> in this reſpect is much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, as <hi>Leland</hi> well noteth.</p>

               <head>The Life of HENRY the Fifth.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>HEnry</hi> the fifth was born at <hi>Monmouth</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> 1388. Of whom ſeveral Authors write, that he was the moſt diſſolute Prince; but all agree that he was afterwards the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:116025:67"/>moſt Martial King that <hi>England</hi> ever bred. For during his Father <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourths Reign, his chief aſſociates were men of evil fame, wicked life, diſſolute carriage, Robbers and Thieves, by whoſe inſtigation he ſtruck the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England;</hi> for which offence he was impriſoned and diſmiſſed of the Preſidentſhip of the Kings Council. With theſe <hi>Fratres in malo</hi> he committed many inſolent pranks; but having attained unto the Crown, he ſummoned theſe his companions before him; and inſtead of preferring them as they expected, he baniſht them for ever from his preſence: yet leaſt they ſhould pretend want of maintenance to be a cauſe of their taking ill courſes he gave to every one of them competent means whereby to ſubſiſt. Having thus reformed himſelf; his next care was to reform his Kingdom; and to this end he aſſembleth a Parliament, as beſt able to informe him for his more diſcreet grievances of his Subjects, and beſt able to counſel him for their redreſs. In this Parliament was a Bill preferred by the Commons againſt the Cleargy, whoſe Temporalities they affirmed would maintain fifteen Earls, fifteen hundred Knights, ſix thouſand two hundred Eſquires, an hundred Alms-Houſes more then before, and unto the Kings Coffers twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds by year. The Cleargy nettled with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Bill, being loath to have their Eſtates looked into, as men who were fuller of goods then of goodneſs, exceeding in riches more then in righteouſneſs, and preaching for Gold more then for God, to divert the Kings minde another way, by the mouth of <hi>Chicholy</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the recovering of his Rights in <hi>France. Henry</hi> as he affected nothing more then true glory, ſo in nothing more then in Warlike action, condeſcends to the motion, ſends Ambaſſadours to the French King to ſurrender him his Land, threatning Fire and Sword upon his refuſal: but a Crown though accompanied with a great many troubles is not ſo eaſily parted withall; yet the French King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116025:68"/>him fair, if he would deſiſt from his intended War, though the <hi>Dolphin</hi> in deriſion ſent him a tun of <hi>Paris</hi> Balls, as fitter for him to exerciſe, then to attempt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the French Crown; which King <hi>Henry</hi> took in ſuch ſcorn, that he ſwore it ſhould not be long ere he would ſend ſuch <hi>London</hi> Balls amongſt them, that ſhould beat down their houſes upon their heads. And to make good his promiſe, he raiſes an Army of 6000. Spears, and 24000. Foot, beſides Engineers and Labourers: but being about to put forth to Sea, a treaſon was diſcovered againſt his perſon, plotted by <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambriage, Henry Scroop</hi> Lord Treaſurer, and <hi>Thomas Gray</hi> Earl of <hi>Northam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland:</hi> Theſe men for a million of Gold were procured by the French Agents to kill the King, but were diſcovered by <hi>Edmond</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> whom they would have drawn into the ſame Conſpiracy. Upon their examination they confeſſed the Treaſon, as likewiſe the receipt of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and were for the ſame immediately put to death. For as Mr. <hi>Charles Allen</hi> writes.</p>

From thence with his Army he marcheth to <hi>Harflew,</hi> which after a few dayes was ſurrendred unto him; where he leaveth Sir <hi>John Falſtaffe</hi> with fifteen hundred men, and takes his way towards <hi>Callis</hi> through the Counties of <hi>Caux</hi> and <hi>Eu.</hi>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixth was then King of <hi>France,</hi> a weak brain-ſick King, his Nobles divided, and the whole Court ſwarming with Factions; yet the common enemy endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering all, they unite in Counſell, and agree the Engliſh ſhould be fought with ere they got to <hi>Callis:</hi> wherefore to impede his proceſs, they brake down the Bridges, plaſhed the Woods, intrenched the wayes, ſtruck ſtakes in Fords, and conveyed all victual out of the Countreys thorow which he ſhould go. Then having raiſed a mighty Army, they ſent <hi>Montjoy</hi> the French King at Arms to defie him, and to let him know he ſhould be fougt with: King <hi>Henry</hi> notwithſtanding his Souldiers were faint and weary, having ſpent their proviſions ſome twelve dayes before, being forced in the mean time to feed upon nuts, roots, and berries, and drink onely water, yet accepted the Challenge, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Herald for his meſſage: then paſſing the River of <hi>Soam,</hi> he came to a Village called <hi>Agen-Court,</hi> encamping from the French Hoaſt not above two hundred and fifty paces.</p>
               <p>Their power (ſaith <hi>Paradin</hi>) conſiſted of an hundred and fifty thouſand Horſe, (beſides them for carriages which were innumerable) the Vantguard was led by the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>France,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Orleance</hi> and <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Ewe, Richmond,</hi> and <hi>Vandoſme,</hi> the Lord <hi>Dempier,</hi> the Lord Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> the Marſhal <hi>Bouciquale,</hi> and others.

The French were ſo confident of victory, that they ſent to King <hi>Henry</hi> to know what Ranſome he would give: but they who rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116025:69"/>without their Hoaſt (we ſay) muſt reckon twice: they might better have ſent to know what Ranſome he would rake, who as full of courage, though not ſo full of bravery, was buſied in the mean time about marſhalling his Army, The Vantguard he committed to the conduct of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the main Battle he commanded himſelf, and the Reer-guard was led by the Duke of <hi>Exeter.</hi> Then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fury of the French Horſe, he commanded two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Bowmen to lodge in a low Meddow, being provided with ſharp ſtakes ſtudded with Iron at both ends, to guard them from danger, and to endamage the French Horſe. The Battels thus ranged, the moſt valiant King gallantly mounted with a chearful countenance, and words full of courage, thus animated his followers, ſomewhat as I have it from other Hiſtorians to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My moſt faithful Companions, and worthy Souldiers, we now are marching into the Field of Honour, which your great valours ſo long have expected and prayed for; loe the day is now come, your enterpriſe is the nobleſt in the world; pour now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forth your undaunted valours, that ages to come may know what the Lance, the Axe, the Sword, and the Bow can do in the hands of Engliſhmen: Whoſoever therefore deſires riches, honour, and rewards, here he ſhall finde them. Nimirum haec medio poſuit Deus omnia campo.</hi> Having this ſaid, his Army fell proſtrate on the ground and committing themſelves to God, their devotions ended, the Drums and Trumpets ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned them to action: the French Vant-guard being exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely appointed, intended with their Horſe to have burſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Archers with a violent courſe, who counterfeiting flight, brought the over-haſty French into the jaws of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; for having left their ſharp pointed ſtakes ſticking in the ground, they miſerably goared the foremoſt of their Enemies Horſes, being preſſed on forward by the following Troops; and then turning head, ſent ſuch tempeſts of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows on the French, that many thouſands their knells were rung out that dreadful day.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:116025:69"/>
               <p>The main Battles joyn together, the Dukes of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Alanzon</hi> like enraged Lions encounter each other; but <hi>Gloceſter</hi> is wounded and overthrown, whoſe body his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry</hi> beſtriding, delivered from further danger, and with redoubled ſtroaks brought the French Gallant himſelf to the ground; with whoſe fall fell the courages of the French, who for all their former bravadoes, they turned their backs ſhamefully and fled, with whom the Reer-guard ran for company, not having ſtruck one ſtroak all this while. In all this fight, which continued three hours, were none taken Priſoners, but the Sword now made weary, and drunk with blood, all danger paſt, and humanity retired, Priſoners were taken, and lives ſpared, which hitherto was neglected, leſt mercy to others might have proved deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things were thus acting, certain of the French Troops led on by <hi>Robert Bondile,</hi> and the Captain of <hi>Agencourt,</hi> fell to rifeling the Kings carriages, being guarded onely by Lackies and Laundreſſes, whoſe terrible ſhreeks made King <hi>Henry</hi> to think ſome freſh Forces were come; certain Troops alſo of the King of <hi>Sicills</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Field, made him give preſent order, that every man ſhould kill his Priſoner, certain principal men onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: then ſetting his men in order, he ſends to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled Troops, either to come to Battle, or depart the Field; but they fearing to drink of the ſame cup their fellows had done, with ſhame and diſhonor depart away. The field thus cleared, and the King by his Scouts ſatisfied that no more enemy was to be ſeen, be cauſed the whole Army in their array as they were, to give thanks unto God, the Clergy then preſent ſinging the Pſalm of <hi>David, In exitu Iſrael de Egypto,</hi> the Footmen kneeling down, and the Horſe men bowing their bodies at this verſe, <hi>Non nobis Domine, non nobis, ſed nomini tuo da gloriam:</hi> Then ſinging; <hi>Te Deum,</hi> with other Hymnes and Anthems, he divideth the rich ſpoil
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116025:70"/>of the enemies Camp among his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>There were ſlain of the French in this Battel above ten thouſand, whereof a hundred twenty and ſix were of the Nobility, bearing Banners; of Knights and Gentlemen of Coat Armour, ſeven thouſand eight hundred and ſeventy four; and of common Souldiers about ſixteen hundred. On the Engliſh ſide the account falls far ſhort, ſome reckon but ſixteen ſlain in all, other ſix and twenty, the moſt not ſix hundred, whereof the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> were chief, whoſe ſlain bodies King <hi>Henry</hi> brought over with him into <hi>England.</hi> The Duke was buried at <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringhey</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> and the Earl at <hi>New-elme</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great was the joy of the Engliſh for the Kings return, the City of <hi>London</hi> receiving him with Triumph as at a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, whilſt <hi>France</hi> lamenteth the loſs of her Nobles. To unite the differences betwixt theſe two Kingdoms, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmond</hi> the Emperour, having been with the French King, cometh over into <hi>England,</hi> and with him the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> as Ambaſſadour from <hi>France,</hi> to treat of peace. <hi>Henry</hi> willingly hearkeneth unto them, and ſends the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Erpingham,</hi> with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Beauvois,</hi> to treat further of the matter; but hearing the French in the mean time had beſieged <hi>Harflew,</hi> he recalleth his Amabſſadours, and would hear no further of peace, but ſendeth his Brother the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> with the Earls of <hi>March, Oxford, Warwick, Huntington, Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Arundel, Devonſhire,</hi> and divers others, with two hundred ſail of Ships, to the reſcue of <hi>Harflew;</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the mouth of the River of <hi>Seyne,</hi> encountred with the French Fleet, commanded by Viſcount <hi>Narbon,</hi> where after a ſharp fight the Victory fell to the Engliſh, who took and ſunk moſt of their Navy, chaſing the reſidue into <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and relieved <hi>Harflew</hi> with men and victuals. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour hereupon leaves mediating any further for peace
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116025:70"/>with <hi>France,</hi> and concludeth a League offenſive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive with King <hi>Henry,</hi> the pope onely excepted, who was the maſter Bee that then lead the ſwarm.</p>
               <p>His affairs finiſhed he returneth homeward, whom King <hi>Henry</hi> accompanieth as far as <hi>Callis,</hi> whither (upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages given for his ſafe return) repaireth the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> who doth homage to the Emperour, and taketh a truce with King <hi>Henry</hi> for his Counties of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Arthois.</hi> Theſe buſineſs ended, <hi>Burgundy</hi> returneth to <hi>Graveling, Henry</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and the Emperour to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But long did not <hi>Henry</hi> remain in <hi>England,</hi> for having raiſed a puiſſant Army, he makes his ſecond expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> accompanied with many Earls and Lords, and an Army of 25527.

                  <hi>Meulan</hi> upon the River of <hi>Sein,</hi> putting all the Engliſh therein to the Sword, but the poſſeſſion was ſhort, and the revenge ſpeedy, being recovered by <hi>Thomas Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who to quit ſcores with the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> killed all the French were found there.</p>
               <p>About this time, the three great pillars of the Engliſh Monarchy in <hi>France,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Bedford, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Brittain,</hi> met at the City of <hi>Amiens</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> to conſult of the whole courſe and ſum of Affairs, adding to the old league this addition, that it ſhould be offenſive and defenſive reſpectively; and to make the friendſhip the more firme, the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> married <hi>Anne</hi> Siſter to <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> a Lady whoſe beauty ſurpaſſed the bluſh that glorified <hi>Luna</hi> when ſhe kiſſed the Shepherd on the Hills of <hi>Latmos.</hi> But whilſt the Regent was thus buſied in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Engliſh cauſe, the Pariſians had a deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, which was by delivering their City up to the French King; but treaſon being ſeldome true to its ſelf, it came to the Regents ear, which coſt the chief conſpirators their lives: and now freſh forces coming out of <hi>England,</hi> his Army augmented, be takes from <hi>Charles</hi> the Towns and Fortreſſes of <hi>Crotoy, Baſide, Riol, Rula, Gyrond, Baſile, Mermound, Milbam, Femil, Seintace,</hi> and many other.</p>
               <p>The French finding themſelves too weak to deal with the Engliſh by force, work by policy; and allure from their ſides, the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and his Brother <hi>Arthur,</hi> who deliver up to the <hi>Dolphin</hi> the Caſtles of <hi>Crotoye</hi> and <hi>Yer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> hating their perfidiouſneſs, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults and takes <hi>Crotoye,</hi> and beſieges <hi>Yerney,</hi> who agree to ſurrender if not relieved by a certain time: the Duke of <hi>Allanſon</hi> with ſixteen thouſand French undertakes the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue; but finding the Engliſh numbers to ſurmount his Arithmetick, he wheeleth about to <hi>Vernoyle</hi> in <hi>Perch,</hi> whom the Regent overtaking a cruel Battel enſued, which for two hours together was maintained with equall courage on
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:116025:77"/>both ſides: the Regent himſelf with a Battel-ax fought moſt fiercely, winning immortal honour in that bloody journey. At length the Victory fell to the Engliſh, though with the loſs of above two thouſand of their men; on the French ſide were ſlain 5. Earls, 2. Viſcounts, 20. Barrons, and above 7000. common Souldiers, beſides 2700. Scots lately arrived; there were taken priſoners the Duke of <hi>Allanſon</hi> himſelf, the Lord of <hi>Herneys,</hi> Sir <hi>John Towrnebull,</hi> 200. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and many common Souldiers. This Battel was fought the 7. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1425. That which followeth till the ſiege of <hi>Orleance,</hi> I have ſet down out of <hi>Paulus Aemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> as <hi>Speed</hi> hath done before me. The fierce Conquerour beſiegeth <hi>Mantz</hi> in <hi>Main,</hi> and with Ordnance beats down part of the Walls: it yields, an Engliſh Garriſon is left there; after the taking which, not being ſufficient to keep the Town in due ſubjection, is compelled to fly to a Tower for their ſafety; the enemies which were admitted into it by the Burgers enjoying the reſt. The Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> (that moſt noble Captain of the Engliſh) with whoſe name <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot is coming,</hi> the French uſed to fright their children, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently arrives to the reſcue, and puts the Malefactors to death. The Engliſh Empire then extented it ſelf at which time, as bath been obſerved, to the River of <hi>Loire. Charles</hi> was called King of <hi>Berry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto the Engliſh fortunes in <hi>France</hi> received no check, their ſerene Sky was without Clouds, ſo long as a good correſpondence was held betwixt the Burgundian and the Engliſh; but this knot of friendſhip was like to have been broken by occaſion of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who married <hi>Jaqueline</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Haynoult, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band were yet living. The Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> his Couſin was greatly offended hereat; inſomuch that the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie grew to be ſo great, that the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> ſent him a challenge: but the Regent well knowing that the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116025:77"/> diſcord of the Engliſh might prove the union of the French, ſo wrought betwixt them that the ſore ſeemed indifferently well healed. Much about that time likewiſe be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a difference between the Protector and Cardinal <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> though to effect the ſame he was fain to come over into <hi>England,</hi> ſubſtituting the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> Lieutenant General in his abſence. But <hi>France</hi> wanting his company he quickly returned, carrying a great number of freſh men over with him. During his abode in <hi>England, Arthur</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> made Conſtable of <hi>France</hi> by King <hi>Charles,</hi> raiſeth an Army of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, and with them ſuddainly beſiegeth St. <hi>Jean,</hi> a Town in <hi>Normandy;</hi> the Garriſon were at firſt diſmayed with their ſudden arrivall, but upon better advice they valliantly ſallied out, crying aloud, a <hi>Salisbury,</hi> a <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe names ſtruck ſuch a terrour into the beſiegers, that with loſs of their Artillery, and 800. of their Company, they betook themſelves to flight.</p>
               <p>To rehearſe each particular would make our diſcourſe prove too prolix; to come to the ſiege of <hi>Orleance,</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by theſe matchleſs Worthies, the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and the Lord <hi>Talbot,</hi> with a puiſſant Army; the Citizens hearing of their intentions prepared to withſtand them: their Suburbs equall in bigneſs to a good City, they level with the ground; chuſing rather to deſtroy a part then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the whole: the Engliſh encompaſs it on every ſide, and the Citizens begin to feel the miſery of want; God when mans help fails, interpoſeth his hand, the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> looking out at a Window to take a view for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſault, is unfortunately ſlain, a ſad loſs for the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; for upon the death of this man (ſaith <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi>) the fortune of the War changed. The Regent to repair this loſs ſendeth Sir <hi>John Falſtaff</hi> with freſh ſupplies, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there ſafe in deſpite of the Lord <hi>De la Brets,</hi> who with nine thouſand men endeavoured to intercept him;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:116025:78"/>hereupon the City would yield, but to the <hi>Burgundian,</hi> not to the Engliſh; a cunning plot to divide their affections: the Regent and his Council being ſent unto, thought it not reaſonable, that the Engliſh having been at all the coſt ſhould not reap the profit; the Burgundian on the other ſide reſented this repulſe ill, as thinking the Engliſh too nice in reſentments of Honour. Whilſt matters ſtood thus betwixt the French and Engliſh, there was preſented unto King <hi>Charles</hi> at <hi>Chinon</hi> a young Maid about eighten years of age, named <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Arc,</hi> who pretended ſhe was ſent from God to deliver <hi>France</hi> from the Engliſh yoak: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe was called <hi>La pucelle de Dieu,</hi> or the Maiden of God, though many judged her but a meer impoſter; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, credit is given to her words; and ſhe being armed like a man, ſhe rides to <hi>Bloyes,</hi> where Forces and Victuals lay for the relief of <hi>Orleance;</hi> her firſt attempt was ſucceſsfull, ſhe with the Admirall and Marſhall of <hi>France</hi> enters ſafe, bringing freſh courage to the dying hopes of the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who upon her encouragements ſally forth, ſlew 600. of the Engliſh, and adventured upon the <hi>Baſtile</hi> where the Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> commanded, who repelled them with great ſlaughter of their men: but yet the next day the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> gave over his Siege and diſperſed his Army into their Garriſons. In memory of this admirable deliverance they of that City erected a Monument, where <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> the Martiall Maid were repreſented, kneeling in Armour, elevating their eyes and hands to heaven, in ſign of thanks and acknowledgement.</p>
               <p>At this time the ſucceſs of War began to be various on both ſides, the Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> took the Town of <hi>Laval</hi> with the Caſtle, but this gains was ſmall in reſpect of the loſs they received at that time; the Duke of <hi>Allanſon</hi> with <hi>Joan</hi> and other great Captains take by aſſault the Town of <hi>Jargeux,</hi> and in it the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> with one of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſlew another of his Brothers, and 200. Souldiers, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:116025:78"/>having his numbers augmented, encounters the Lord <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> at a village called <hi>Patay,</hi> whom he diſcomfits, and ſlew of the Engliſh above a thouſand. The Lords, <hi>Talbot,</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Engliſh, <hi>Scales, Hungerford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtone</hi> were taken priſoners; theſe loſſes ſhook the whole fabrick of the Engliſh greatneſs in <hi>France,</hi> and cauſed the revolt of many Towns to King <hi>Charles;</hi> who encouraged by theſe ſucceſſes marcheth into <hi>Champaigne,</hi> where by compoſition he taketh the Cities of <hi>Troys</hi> and <hi>Auxerre, Chalous</hi> and <hi>Rheimes</hi> yield themſelves; in which laſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Maids direction, he was ſolemnly Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> upon the upleaſant tydings of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance</hi> reſcued, and <hi>Talbot</hi> taken, oppoſeth himſelf; and having an Army of ten thouſand Engliſh, beſides Normans, marcheth out of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſending letter of defiance to the French King, affirming, that deceitfully and by unjuſt means he had ſtollen many Cities and places of importance belonging to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which he was come to juſtifie by Battel, if he would appoint a time and place, who returned anſwer by the Herald, that he would ſooner ſeek the Duke, then the Duke ſhould need to purſue him: yet notwithſtanding his brags, upon the Dukes approach he marcheth away; the Regent follows and overtakes him at <hi>Senlys,</hi> there both the Armies encamped and embattel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet onely ſome light Skirmiſhes paſſed between them; for the French King either thorow ſear, or policy, or both, in the night time fled to <hi>Bray:</hi> the Engliſh Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers deeming it fear, would have purſued him, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent judging it to be his policy to draw him further from the City of <hi>Paris</hi> (of whoſe fidelity he had no great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) refuſed to follow him any further. The Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Cardinal <hi>Beaufort,</hi> having at that preſent raiſed four thouſand men in aid of the Pope, to ſuppreſs the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, who began to ſlight his Pontifical pomp, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:116025:79"/>of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> went over with them to the Regent, for a preſent expedition againſt King <hi>Charles,</hi> who by the ſubtil working of the <hi>Pucelle</hi> was received into <hi>Campaigne,</hi> and had many Towns of importance rendred unto him. Yet notwithſtanding his numbers exceeded twice the Regents, yet by no provocations could he be drawn to Battel, but ſecretly fled to <hi>Criſpis;</hi> whereupon the Regent alſo returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he ſtaid but a while, but paſſeth into <hi>Normandy,</hi> to provide for a ſafe retreat there, if the Engliſh (by the inevitable will of God) ſhould be driven out of their other Dominions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them as their anceſtours had alwayes been, to be true and faithful to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the French King was not idle, but gets by practice the Town of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> from whence he ſends the Duke of <hi>Allanſon,</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> the Martial Maid, to try their Friends and Fortunes at <hi>Paris;</hi> but <hi>Joans</hi> good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune having aſcended the Meridian, began now to decline; for the Engliſh gave them ſo rough an encounter, that <hi>Joan</hi> her ſelf was wounded, and the reſt with much ſlaughter forced to fly: the Regent hearing of theſe attempts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to <hi>Paris,</hi> commending the Souldiers for their vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and valour in reſiſting the French; and having freſh ſupplies out of <hi>England,</hi> marcheth to reduce <hi>Champaign</hi> to his obedience. The French under the conduct of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Virago attempt to raiſe the ſiege, and enter in deſpight of the Engliſh and Burgundians that beſieged it; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſallying forth, their troops were beaten, and <hi>Joan</hi> her ſelf taken priſoner by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> a Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Knight; who for the value of ten thouſand pounds Turnoyes, and three hundred crowns yearly rent, delivered her to the Regent, and he to the Biſhop of <hi>Beauvois,</hi> in whoſe Dioceſs ſhe was taken; who judicially proceeding againſt her as a Sorcereſs, and deceiver of the King and his Subjects, ſhe was condemned, and afterwards burnt to death at <hi>Roan.</hi>

The King at that preſent lying very ſick, he neglects no advantage, but by the help of his friends wrought ſo effectually, that the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> was ſent to the Tower: this man was exceedingly hated of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, conceiving him the chief cauſe that all <hi>Normandy</hi> was ſurrendered into the hands of the French; of which their malice the Duke of <hi>York</hi> made good uſe, though his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the removing him out of the way, was the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance he knew he would prove to his after claim of the Crown: but when the King had recovered his ſtrength again, and reſumed to him his Princely Government, he cauſed the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> to be ſet at liberty, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him to be Captain of <hi>Calice;</hi> wherewith, not onely the Commons, but many of the Nobility which favoured the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> were greatly offended, ſaying, that he had loſt <hi>Normandy</hi> already, and would alſo loſe <hi>Calice.</hi>

               <p>Hereupon the Duke of <hi>York</hi> with his adherents, the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the Lords, <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Fawconbridge,</hi> with many other Knights and Eſquires, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Army about the edge of <hi>Wales,</hi> and marched with the ſame towards <hi>London.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> being informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, aſſembled likewiſe an hoſt to reſiſt them; and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Dukes of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Stafford, Wiltſhire, Dorſet, Pembroke,</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> the Lords, <hi>Clifford, Sudley, Barnes, Roſe,</hi> and many others, marched againſt him: at Saint <hi>Albons</hi> both Armies met, where betwixt them was fought a ſore Battel; which continuing doubtfull for a time, the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> with great courage breaking in upon them, and crying, a <hi>Warwick,</hi> a <hi>Warwick,</hi> diſcomfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Kings ſide with a great ſlaughter, no leſs then five thouſand loſing their lives; among whom the chiefeſt was the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116025:82"/>
                  <hi>Stafford,</hi> the old Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> with many other Knights and Gentlemen; the King himſelf being wounded, was taken priſoner, and the next day carried to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after began a Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was made Protector of the Realm, the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Lord Chancellour, and the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> Captain of <hi>Calice,</hi> and the Territories of the ſame; and thus the rule of the Realm reſted in the Duke and Chancellour, and all the Warlike Affairs in the Earl of <hi>Warwick:</hi> the Kings authority conſiſting onely in name, which they made uſe of for their own ends upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>But the Queen ſtomacking theſe high indignities done to the King, ſtudies revenge; and making ſure to her ſide many of the Lords, under a pretence of hunting, conveyes the King to <hi>Coventry:</hi> whither in a friendly way ſhe ſends for the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> to which place the ſaid Lords reſort: but having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret intelligence that miſchief was intended againſt them, they privately departed from the Court, with mindes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd againſt the Queen and her party; but thorow the mediation of ſome Lords, together with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> all parties meeting together at <hi>London,</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was concluded on, with many outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſhews of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>But this calm laſted not long, the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> upon ſome debate betwixt him and the Kings ſervants, was by them aſſaulted, and for ſafety of his life forced to fly unto <hi>Calice</hi> in a Barge: this affront done unto him was ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another, a Privy Seal being directed to him for the diſcharging of him of the Captainſhip of <hi>Calice,</hi> the young Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (his enemy) being conſtituted Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in his room. But for as much as he had his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Parliament, he would not obey the Privy Seal; and to ſhow his abilities fit for the mannagement of any deſign,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:116025:82"/>he with fourteen ſail of Ships, ſets forth to ſcowre the Seas, bringing home in little ſpace, prizes to the value of ten thouſand pound; a conſiderable ſum in that age, before the <hi>Indies</hi> wealth overflowed <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and Earl of <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> aſſemble an Army to revenge the injuries done to the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> to oppoſe whom, the Queen ſent <hi>James Twichet</hi> Lord <hi>Audley:</hi> at <hi>Blore-heath</hi> near <hi>Muckleſtone</hi> both Armies met, where the Lord <hi>Audley</hi> was overthrown himſelf, and 2400. of his men ſlain.</p>
               <p>And now the Conquerours reſolve to unvizard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to raiſe what forces they could for the obtaining of their purpoſes. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> bringing to them a very great power from <hi>Calice;</hi> the King on the other ſide raiſes a mighty great Army, and having marched as far as <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to fave the effuſion of blood, ſent unto them <hi>Richard Beauchamp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> with a general Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, if they would give over their enterpriſe: yet upon further advice, having ſent an excuſatory Letter to the King, they withdrew themſelves into divers parts beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p>Soon after was a Parliament holden at <hi>Coventry,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Duke of <hi>York, Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> his Son and Heire, the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> with many other Lord and Gentlemen, were attainted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. One Sir <hi>Baldwine Fulford</hi> undertook on pain of loſing his head that he would deſtroy the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> but having ſpent the King a thouſand marks, returned without effecting his purpoſe. On the other ſide the Earl of <hi>VVarwick</hi> ſent ſome of his men, who by night coming to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> carried away the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> and Sir <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny VVoodvile</hi> his Son, with many great Ships.</p>
               <p>And now the Earls of <hi>March, VVarwick</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> being invited by the Kentiſhmen, croſſed the Sea, and landed at <hi>Sandwich;</hi> where they were met by <hi>Thomas Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:116025:83"/>Archbiſhip of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and many others, who conducted them to <hi>London,</hi> in moſt ſolemn manner; where having convocated the Cleargy in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, the Earl of <hi>VVarwick</hi> in name of the reſt took his oath upon the Croſs of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that they had ever borne true faith and allegiance to King <hi>Henry.</hi> Having by this oath gained credence of the Citizens, they leave the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> Governour thereof, and with their Forces march down to <hi>Northampton</hi> where the King then lay, with a ſtrong power; and firſt they affay to get him into their hands by fair means, but that not prevailing, they reſolve force: whereupon both Hoſts encountred each other; but the Lord <hi>Edmond Grey</hi> of <hi>Ruthen</hi> who commanded the Kings Voward, forſaking his ſide and joyning with the Earl, by that means ſet a palm of Victory upon his head, and a Character of Treachery upon his own, for betraying the truſt repoſed in him. There were ſlain on the Kings part th Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> the Lords <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and <hi>Egremont,</hi> with many Knights and Eſquires; the King himſelf was taken priſoner, and with ſeeming liberty conveyed to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to authoriſe their actions the better, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is call'd, wherein it was agreed, that King <hi>Henry</hi> in (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a long ſucceſſion) ſhould enjoy the Crown during his natrual life, which afterwards ſhould devolve to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> and his Heires, in whom it was then apparently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Title to the Kingdom did remain; in which agreement was likewiſe manifeſted, that <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould make immediate forfeiture, whenſoever either he or any of his Party ſhould attempt to diſanul this act.</p>
               <p>But the Queen with many of the Lords, not being at the bargain making, thought themſelves not tied to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; whereupon, ſhe having in her company the Prince her Son, the Dukes of <hi>Exeter</hi> and <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> and in effect all the Lords of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:116025:83"/>the North, with an Army of 18000. men marched from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Wakefield,</hi> with whom joyned the Lord <hi>Nevill</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Earl of <hi>Weſtmorland;</hi> who having gotten a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> under his name raiſed 8000. men, but brought them all to the adverſe party.</p>
               <p>But the Duke of <hi>York</hi> whom fortune had hitherto wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as his hand-maid, nothing daunted at their number, leaving the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and the Earl of <hi>VVarwick</hi> to attend the King, he with the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and his Son the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> with about ſome five thouſand men marched againſt them: and although his numbers was nothing competent to his enemies, yet would he not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed but gave them Battel; ſo that being encompaſſed on all ſides, thorow his own raſhneſs was himſelf ſlain, and his whole Army diſcomfitted; his Son the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> (being but twelve years old) ſtabbed by the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> his tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty friend the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> beheaded by the common people, and his own head fixt on a pole, with a paper Crown, was ſet on the Walls of <hi>York,</hi> for the barbarous mirth of the uncivil multitude.</p>
               <p>The unwelcome news of the Dukes overthrow coming to the Ears of <hi>VVarwick,</hi> to ſtop the torrent of the Queens proceedings, he muſters all the men he could, and taking King <hi>Henry</hi> along with him, marches from <hi>London</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Queen; at St. <hi>Albans</hi> both Armies met, where <hi>VVarwick</hi> loſt the day, with the ſlaughter of two thouſand of his men: King <hi>Henry</hi> alſo, (whom fortune neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured amongſt friends nor foe;) was again taken. This Victory of the Queens had it been diſcreetly mannaged; might have turned the ſcales on the Lancaſtarian ſide, but ſhe wanton with ſucceſs, vainly imagined a ſecurity from future competition, and either wanted power to reſtrain her Souldiers, or licenſed them to a free ſpoil; by which unruly violence ſhe untied the affections of the Commons, who by their quiet and profit, meaſure the vertues of their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116025:84"/>Princes. So that the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> fearing to be plundered, hearing of their approach, ſhut up their Gates, and arm'd for reſiſtance. The Queen hereupon with her plundering Army retires Northwards, where we will leave her for a time, and look back upon the Earl of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who being at <hi>Gloceſter</hi> at ſuch time as he heard news of his Fathers death, ſpent not his time in womaniſh lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but conſidering how dangerous leaſure in to increaſe the apprehenſion of misfortune, having encreaſed his Army with ſome additional forces, he marches againſt the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Ormand,</hi> who had raiſed a great power with purpoſe to ſurpriſe him. Near <hi>Mortimers</hi> Croſs on <hi>Candlemaſs</hi>-day they encountred each other, where the two Earls and their whole Army were put to flight with the ſlaughter of there thouſand eight hundred on the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> having obtained this Victory, with his Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant forces directeth his march towards <hi>London;</hi> in the way at <hi>Chipping-Norton</hi> he met the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing daunted at his late misfortune, and coveting nothing more then by the tryal of a new day to perſwade, or elſe to force back victory to his ſide: then enter they <hi>London</hi> in a triumphant manner, the Citizens receiving them with great acclamations of joy, the Earl of <hi>March</hi> wich a joynt conſent of them all is choſen King, and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed throughout the City, by the name of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth.</p>
               <p>This was done at <hi>London;</hi> in the mean time the Queen and the Lords of her ſide were daring and vigilant in the North; and having raiſed threeſcore thouſand fighting men, they reſolved with expence of their blood, to buy back that Majeſty, which the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> by evill fate had loſt. <hi>Edward</hi> chooſing rather to provoke then expect an enemy, having muſtered what Forces he could, with his truſty friend the Earl of <hi>VVarwick,</hi> marches againſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116025:84"/>them; and notwithſtanding his Army came far ſhort of the others in number, yet by his Captains good conduct, and his Souldiers valour, joyning battel between <hi>Caxton</hi> and <hi>Towton,</hi> he gave his enemies a mighty great overthrow. In no one battel was ever poured froth ſo much Engliſh blood, ſix and thirty thouſand, ſeven hundred ſeventy ſix perſons, all of one Nation, many near in alliance, ſome in blood; fatally divided by faction, were now united in death. On the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> ſide were ſlain the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>VVeſtmorland,</hi> the Lords, <hi>Clifford, Beaumont, D'acres, Gray,</hi> and <hi>VVells, John</hi> Lord <hi>Nevill</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>VVeſtmorland,</hi> with divers others. On King <hi>Edwards</hi> ſide, the Lord <hi>Fitz-VValter,</hi> and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> with many others of great reputation and courage. King <hi>Henry</hi> with the poor remains of his party fleeth into <hi>Scotland,</hi> whileſt <hi>Edward</hi> in triumph re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this great overthrow, yet did not the indefatigable Queen loſe any thing from her ſpirit or endeavours, but makes addreſſes to all Princes abroad, whom alliance, reaſon of ſtate, or compaſſion of ſo great a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, might move to her aſſiſtance; and notwithſtanding all her endeavours, ſhe gathered together but five hundred French; yet adding hope to her ſmall number, ſhe croſſes the Sea with them into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Here ſome thin Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Scots reſorted to her, in whoſe company, taking her Husband King <hi>Henry</hi> along with her, ſhe enters <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but this ſmall number (ſcarcely deſerving the name of an Army) were ſoon overthrown by the Lord <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue;</hi> moſt of the Lords of her ſide taken and beheaded. King <hi>Henry</hi> eſcaped from the Battel, but was ſoon after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as he ſat at dinner at <hi>VVaddington-Hall</hi> in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> and by the Earl of <hi>VVarwick</hi> brought priſoner to <hi>London,</hi> and committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe great ſervices done by <hi>VVarwick</hi> and his Brother
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:116025:85"/>
                  <hi>Mountague</hi> for King <hi>Edward,</hi> made them ſet ſo high a price upon their merits, that the greateſt benefits he could beſtow upon them, were received in the degree of a debt, not a gift; and thereupon their expectations being not anſwered according to their imaginations, they begin to look upon <hi>Edward</hi> with a rancorous eye; and certainly this was the main cauſe of their falling off from <hi>Edwards</hi> ſide, though for a while they diſſembled the ſame, untill they ſhould meet with a more plauſible occaſion, which ſoon after was offered unto them: for the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> being ſent over into <hi>France,</hi> to negotiate a marriage betwixt King <hi>Edward,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Bona</hi> Siſter to the French Queen; whileſt he was buſie in courting this Lady, <hi>Edward</hi> following more his fancy then reaſons of State, falls in love, and marries the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter to the Dutches of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and widdow of Sir <hi>John Gray,</hi> ſlain on King <hi>Henries</hi> part at the Battel of St. <hi>Albans.</hi> But when the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> underſtood how mighty an affront by this was given to his employment, he entertained none but diſdainfull thoughts againſt his Prince. And expreſt ſo bold a diſcontent, that <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who was quick to perceive, and carefull to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any diſpleaſure, which might tend to the diſturbance of another Kingdom, began to enter into private commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with him; for ever after this common injury, (ſo they called the errour of love in the King) the Earl held a dangerous intelligence in France, which after occaſioned ſo many confuſions to our Kingdom. Nevertheleſs upon his return he diſſembled all diſcontent, and in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of reſpect applyed himſelf to applaud the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and in particular, the excellent perſonage of the Queen.</p>
               <p>But long did not the fire of his revenge lie hid under the aſhes of diſſimulation; for King <hi>Edward</hi> grown ſecure by an over-bold preſumption, the daughter of a long proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:116025:85"/>gave himſelf over to all licentiouſneſs, whilſt <hi>Warwick</hi> had made his faction not onely mighty, but monſtrous, being compacted of ſeveral natures: for into conſpiracy of this great enterprize he had drawn off the Cleargy and the Laity, and moſt of them of affections moſt oppoſite. The Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> was the principal mover, becauſe he mov'd upon the ſoul, and made treaſon an act of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the eaſie multitude who build their faith upon the man, not the Doctrine, thinking it meritorious to rebell, in regard his function ſeem'd to give authority to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. With him a greed the Marqueſs <hi>Mountague,</hi> and many eminent perſons of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Court, whom either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of War, having never lived but in the troubled Sea of diſcord, or want of expected recompence, rendered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented.</p>
               <p>All the partakers in the calamity of the houſe of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> moſt paſſionately at firſt overture embraced this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; amongſt whom was <hi>Henry Holland</hi> Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who after his ruine with the fall of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was reduced to ſuch extremity, that ragged and bare-footed he begg'd for his meat in the Low-Countries. But the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the world then was at the powerful ſorcery of thoſe perſwaſions, which bewitcht the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> the Kings Brother to this conſpiracy, to whom the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> (to tye him the faſter to his ſide) gave him in marriage the Lady <hi>Iſabel</hi> his daughter, and coheire to the rich Earldom of <hi>Warwick;</hi> for conſummation whereof they ſailed over to <hi>Calice,</hi> of which Town the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was Captain, and in which the young Lady then remained with her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Soon was the Ceremony paſt, and ſoon did the Earl invite his Son-in-law from the ſoftneſs of the Nuptial Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, as who had contrived this marriage for buſineſs, not for pleaſure; and deſign'd the firſt iſſue of their embraces to be a monſter, and the moſt unnatural one; War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Brothers.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:116025:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warwick</hi> having thus politickly order'd things, that he left little or nothing to fortune, with his Son-in-law returns to <hi>England;</hi> where againſt his return, the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> with ſome other of his friends, had raiſed a potent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; to oppoſe whom, on <hi>Edwards</hi> ſide aſſembles a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power, under the conduct of the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire:</hi> but they falling out at <hi>Banbury</hi> upon a trivial occaſion, made way for the enemy to conquer them both. This overthrow was ſeconded with a great loſs at <hi>Grafton</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> wherein the Earl <hi>Rivers</hi> and the Lord <hi>Widdevil.</hi> Father and Brother to the Queen, were taken, and barbarouſly beheaded. <hi>Edward</hi> nettled with theſe loſſes, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes what power he could, and marches againſt <hi>Warwick;</hi> whoſe pretence being that of all Rebells, <hi>The good of the Kingdom;</hi> yet to avoid effuſion of blood, ſeemingly is very deſirous of peace; but when with ſeveral overtures he had lulled the King in ſecurity, in the dead of the night, he ſets upon his Army, kills the watch, and ſurpriſeth his perſon, buried in a careleſs ſleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warwick</hi> having thus gotten the prey into his hand he ſo long deſired, ſends him priſoner to <hi>Middleham</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> there to be kept by his Brother the Archbiſhop of that Sea; but King <hi>Edward</hi> being of another temper then his predeceſſour <hi>Henry,</hi> not enduring Captivity, ſoon found a way for his own liberty: for having gotten licence to hunt in the adjoyning Park, he ſo contrived with Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Burgh,</hi> that with a ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed number they came to his reſcue, and took him away from his weak guard; the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> joyning to them with ſome forces he had raiſed about <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> they march directly to <hi>London,</hi> where they were entertained with great expreſſions of joy.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> (who upon the taking of the King had disbanded his Army) hearing of his eſcape, was almoſt diſtracted with a thouſand ſeveral imaginations; but ſoon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:116025:86"/>by letters to the Lords of his faction, he reaſſembles his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and marches againſt the King: but thorow the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome perſons inclinable to peace, an enterveiw was agreed on in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall; and oaths for ſafety being paſt on both ſides, accordingly they met; but ſuch intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Language paſt at their meeting, as rather aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then allayed their anger; ſo that now they reſolved the Sword alone ſhould decide the controverſie. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> leaving his Army under the command of Sir <hi>Robert Wells</hi> whilſt he himſelf went to raiſe more men; King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> neglecting not the opportunity, whileſt they were thus disjoyned, gives them battel, and overthrows them, with the loſs of ten thouſand of their men. Sir <hi>Robert Wells</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoner, and ſoon after beheaded. This overthrow ſtruck <hi>Warwick</hi> to the heart; ſo that having not ſufficient force to withſtand the King, he with the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> ſail over into <hi>France,</hi> with which King, as alſo with Queen <hi>Margret,</hi> who then remained in the French Court, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a combination for the depoſing of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſetting up again King <hi>Henry.</hi> And that there might not be left any tract of former diſcontent, or path to future jealouſie, a marriage was concluded and celebrated between Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Queens Son, and the Lady <hi>Anne</hi> younger daughter to the Earl; and for want of iſſue of theſe two, the Crown to come to <hi>Clarence</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
               <p>Matters thus concluded, and the French King ſupplying them with money, they return into <hi>England</hi> to whom flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt all the Lords; the Commonalty alſo (deſirous of innovation) adhered unto them: ſo that King <hi>Edward</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in a manner wholly abandoned, was forced to quit the Land, and ſail into <hi>Holland.</hi>

               <p>And now notwithſtanding his former hoſtility with him, <hi>Warwick</hi> reſtores King <hi>Henry</hi> to all his former dignity and honour; a Parliament is called, wherein nothing is denyed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:116025:87"/>which the prevailing party thought fit to be authorized: King <hi>Edward</hi> condemned for a Tyranous Uſurper, and all his adherents attainted of high treaſon; the Crown is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon King <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heires Males, for default of which, to <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and his Heires for ever. The Earls of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Pembroke,</hi> and many others, reſtored to their eſtates and titles; the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> put in poſſeſſion of the Dutchy of <hi>York;</hi> and laſtly the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the King and Kingdom committed to the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> ſo that King <hi>Henry</hi> poſſeſt no more then the name of King, and ſeem'd not to be ſet at liberty, but to have changed his keeper.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> in the mean time, having hired four great <hi>Holland</hi> Ships, and fourteen Eaſterling men of War, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports his Army over into <hi>England,</hi> which conſiſted of two thouſand Dutch men, and ſuch Engliſh as accompanied him in his flight, or had eſcaped over after him; at <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> he landed, from thence he marched to <hi>York,</hi> but finding in every place where he came the people generally devoted to the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> he faſhioned his behaviour to a new art, and ſolemnly took his oath that his intentions was not for the recovering of the Crown, but regaining the Dutchy of <hi>York,</hi> wrongfully conferred on his Brother <hi>Clarence</hi> by the laſt Parliament. Hereupon many of note joyned themſelves with him, ſo that whom they refuſed to ſerve as King, which had been an act of loyalty, they condeſcend to aid as Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which was abſolute rebellion: it being high treaſon in a Subject, though never ſo apparently injured, to ſeek his remedy by Arms. Having thus increaſt his Army he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es towards <hi>London;</hi> and although the Marqueſs <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, Warwicks</hi> Brother, with a far ſuperiour power lay then at <hi>Pomfret</hi> to impeach his journey, yet let he him quietly paſs, not permitting any act of hoſtillity to be ſhewed, or advantage taken; by which groſs overſight he ruined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:116025:87"/>and <hi>Warwick</hi> too: for no ſooner was <hi>Edward</hi> paſt this danger, but many of the Nobility with mighty Forces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to him. Whereupon forgetting his oath, he takes upon him the title of King, and marcht directly to <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> fierce in his deſire to give <hi>Warwick</hi> battel, who lay there encampt; and now his Brother <hi>Clarence</hi> with all his Forces forſakes his Father-in-law the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and joynes with his Brother. Hereupon uniting their Forces they march up to <hi>London,</hi> which after ſome ſhow of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſubmitted its ſelf. <hi>Warwick</hi> having now joyned with his Brother <hi>Mountague,</hi> follows after him; whom to oppoſe, King <hi>Edward</hi> having ſettled the Town to his obedience, led forth his Army; at St. <hi>Albans</hi> they both met, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them was fought a moſt bloody battel, in which the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and his Brother <hi>Mountague</hi> valiantly fighting were both ſlain, and their whole Army totally routed.</p>
               <p>To this violent end came the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how was it poſſible ſuch a ſtormy life could expect a calmer death; he was queſtionleſs valiant, for a Coward durſt not have thought thoſe dangers into which he entred upon the ſlighteſt quarrels. His ſoul was never quiet, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſted ſtill with the preſent; and his pride like a fooliſh builder, ſo delighted to pull down and ſet up, that at length part of the frame that himſelf had raiſed, fell upon him and cruſht him to death. His varying ſo in approving contrary Titles, ſhewed either a ſtrange levity in judgement, or elſe that ambition, not conſcience, ruled his actions. In ſum, that greatneſs he ſo violently laboured to confirme in his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, came all to nothing; Almighty God ruining their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, who think by pollicy (though contrary to Religion) to perpetuate their poſterity.</p>

               <head>The Life of King RICHARD the Third.</head>
               <p>FRom the pen of ſo credible an Author as Sir <hi>Tho. Moor</hi> was (to other Hiſtorians) chiefly derived the Hiſtory of this King; they ſo admiring and truſting to what he delivered, that without any alteration of his words (an unuſual reſpect) we have hitherto (except two or three other Modern differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Writers) received all from the Knights Tradition. He was a perſon indeed of unqueſtioned integrity, but how careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honeſtly his Works by others might be publiſht after his death is not yet well determined. Sir <hi>Simon D'ewes</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and other eminent Antiquaries of our times, being in their learned diſcourſes often too ſenſible of ſome abuſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Chronicle of this <hi>Richard.</hi> The truth is, if as in reſpect of our own times, we have known the beſt of men ſo traduce, certainly where there hath been ſome more then ordinary failings, envious perſons will think they cannot render him odious, or ugly enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> the Third vulgarly known by the name of Crook-Backt, and ſo delivered by ſome Hiſtorians and Poets, with what truth I know not, ſince his Picture drawn in his life, and as it is ſaid to be to the life, ſtill preſerved and ſuffered by his great enemy <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh in the Long Gallery in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> denotes the contrary, and ſhews him him to be of a ſweet and gracious aſpect. And <hi>John Stow,</hi> who alwayes took great pains in his inquiry of the relations of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Princes, ſayes, That he had ſpoken with ſome ancient men, who from their own ſight and knowledge affirm that he was of body and ſhape comely. Neither did <hi>John Rouce</hi> who knew him, and wrote much in his deſcription, obſerves any otherwiſe. But whether crooked or no, if his actions
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:116025:88"/>were ſtraight, poſterity hath the leſs to cenſure him.</p>
               <p>He was the youngeſt Son of <hi>Richard Plantagenet,</hi> the fourth Duke of <hi>York</hi> of that Royal Family; born at the Caſtle of <hi>Fotheringham,</hi> or as ſome write, the Caſtle of <hi>Berkhamſteed,</hi> about the year of our Lord 1450. a dutiful Son to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a Loyal Subject to his Brother, who ſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes firm to his ſide in that great defection of the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> and Earl of <hi>VVarwick,</hi> as we have declared in the preceding life. At the death of his Brother King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> he was choſen Lord Protector; and afterwards by the importunity of the people (knowing his Abilities) forced to take upon him the Regal Power, and confirmed by Act of Parliament. Therefore their cavils are vain, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an extream malice and envy unto him, that report him to have obtained the Sovereignty by indirect means. As for his abillities for government, hear Reverend <hi>Cambden,</hi> an Author without exception, <hi>Fuit digniſſimus regno, &amp;c, non inter malos ſed bonos Principes, commemorandus.</hi> That he was moſt worthy to Reign, and to be numbered amongſt the good, not bad Princes. And indeed thoſe many and good Laws enacted in his time demonſtrate him a good King, though ſome have reported him to be a bad Man.</p>
               <p>He was Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with great ſolemnity, moſt of the Peers of the Land being preſent; ſoon after his Coronation, he ſent to the French King for his Tribute, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly paid to his Brother <hi>Edward,</hi> in leiu of the Dutchy and Countries of <hi>Aquitain, Normandy, Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Maine,</hi> &amp;c. and now detained by the French King; and doubtleſs King <hi>Richard</hi> had ſtill compelled him to continue it, had not eruptions of State and tumultary practices fatally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his Sword.</p>
               <p>Soon after was a Parliament called, wherein was attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of High Treaſon, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond, John</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford, Thomas</hi> Marques of <hi>Dorſet, Jaſper</hi> Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, Lionel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury, Pierce</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:116025:89"/>the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Richmond, Thomas Morton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> with many others. King <hi>Edwards</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for whom the world ſo much cenſures him, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged uncapable of Government, and the Crown by a Parliament in thoſe dayes confirmed to King <hi>Richard,</hi> in theſe words. <hi>It is declared, pronounced, decreed, confirmed; and eſtabliſhed, by the authority of this preſent aſſembly of Parliament, that King</hi> Richard <hi>the Third is the true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted King of this Realm, as well by right of Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Heritage, as by lawful Election and Coronation,</hi> &amp;c. So that here to tax ſo general an aſſent, were to ſay, there were not one honeſt nor juſt man in that High Court; and what greater ſcandall to the whole Kingdom, and to thoſe that have ſince ſucceeded them.</p>
               <p>But as Honour is alwayes attended on by Envy, ſo hath this worthy Princes fame been blaſted by malicious tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who like <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> in his Play of him, render him dreadfully black in his actions, a monſter of nature rather then a man of admirable parts, whoſe ſlanders having been examined by wiſe and moderate men, they have onely found malice and ignorance to have been his greateſt accuſers, perſons who can onely lay ſuſpition to his charge; and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition in Law is no more guilt then imagination, as the divine Father <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> faith, A good man hardly ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth another to be evill; but an evill man ſcarcely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth any to be good. King <hi>Richard</hi> had three great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, as Princes are ſeldome without ſome, and thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtant cuſtom of the World muſt be envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Cateſby, Ratcliffe,</hi> and <hi>Lovel:</hi> King <hi>Richards</hi> own Arms being the Bore, upon which one <hi>Collingborne</hi> of the Weſt fancied this Libel, which in thoſe times was received for excellent Wit.</p>

                  <l>The Cat, the Rat, and <hi>Lovel</hi> the Dog,</l>
                  <l>Rule all <hi>England</hi> under a Hog.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But leaving ſuch trifles, to return to King <hi>Richard. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:116025:89"/>Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> ambitious of Sovereignty, envying his proſperity, practiſes with forreign Princes, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with the Engliſh Nobles, for Aſſiſtance and Forces againſt King <hi>Richard.</hi> The chief abettor in <hi>England</hi> he had on his ſide was the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> one who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conſtantly adhered to King <hi>Richards</hi> ſide; but being by him denyed the Earldome of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and Conſtable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>England,</hi> grew diſcontented, took up Arms, was defeated, and afterwards by Marſhall Law put to death.</p>
               <p>Yet did not this break the neck of <hi>Henries</hi> deſign, but having by his fair deportment gained Force; from the Duke of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and ſome other Princes envious of the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Houſe of <hi>York, Richmond</hi> puts forth to Sea, and lands at <hi>Milford-Haven</hi> in <hi>Wales;</hi> after ſome refreſhing he marches to a Town called <hi>Haverford-Weſt,</hi> where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (who flocked to him in great number) welcomed him as a Prince, deſcended from their ancient Princes of <hi>Wales:</hi> the people generally being very noble, and loving to their Brittiſh Kindred. Hither came to him with great Forces, the Earl of <hi>Salop,</hi> Sir <hi>Rice ap Thomas,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Herbert,</hi> Sir <hi>John Savage,</hi> Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot,</hi> and many others. His Army thus ſtrong and united, he paſſes the <hi>Severne,</hi> and marches to <hi>Leichfield.</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> hearing of his arrivall prepareth againſt him, but though he thought the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity generally cemented to his ſide, yet found he a general defluxion from them to the other ſide; the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Lovel,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> being the principall that ſtuck to him; which laſt, was much importuned to have fallen off from him: the night before the Battel one writing this Rime upon his Gate.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>

               </q>
               <p>But he regarding more his fidelity, then any danger that could befall him, doubles his care and diligence on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:116025:90"/>of his Sovereign. The Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who had received great favours from the King, and who had in his Name raiſed vaſte Forces, being ſent for by him, refuſed to come; pretending for his diſobedience, certain dreams, wherein he was forewarned by his Father for to fight on King <hi>Richards</hi> ſide. But the greateſt defection was in the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> who notwithſtanding he had left his Sonne <hi>George Stanley</hi> as a Pledge of his faith with the King, yet revolted to the other ſide. King <hi>Richard</hi> notwithſtanding all theſe diſadvantages, having encouraged his Army, gives <hi>Richmond</hi> a Battle; where valiantly fighting, after he had with his own hands ſlain Sir <hi>Charls Brandon</hi> the Earls Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearer, and unhorſed Sir <hi>John Cheny,</hi> and ſhewed himſelf a moſt Heroick Perſon, being over-powered with multitude, he was ſlain on the place. With him died the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> was taken Priſoner, and the whole Army quite defeated. This Battle was fought at a Village called <hi>Boſworth</hi> near to <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> The Victor was crowned in the Field by Sir <hi>VVilliam Stanley</hi> with King <hi>Richards</hi> Crown, which he as a valiant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Maſter of his right had worn that day. King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi> dead body after it was moſt barbarouſly mangled and wounded, was thrown behinde one upon a lean Jade, and ſo conveyed to <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> where at laſt it obtained a bed of earth, honourably appointed by the order of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, in the chief Church of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> called Saint <hi>Maries,</hi> belonging to the Order and Society of Grey Friers, the King in ſhort time after cauſing a fair Tomb of mingled colour'd Marble, adorned with his Statue, to be erected thereupon.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding the times were ſuch when this great Prince lived, that he had ſcarcely time to ſheath his ſword, yet left he behinde him many Monuments of his Piety. He founded a Collegiate Church of Prieſts in <hi>Middleham</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire;</hi> another Colledge of Prieſts in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Tower-ſtreet,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:116025:90"/>near to the Church called our Lady <hi>Barking;</hi> he built a Church or Chappel in <hi>Towton</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire;</hi> he founded a Colledge in <hi>York</hi> convenient for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an hundred Prieſts; he built the high ſtone Tower at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and when he had repaired and fortified the Caſtle of <hi>Carlile,</hi> he founded and built the Caſtle of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith</hi> in <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He began many other good Works, which his ſudden fatt prevented, as <hi>Polidor Virgil</hi> witneſſeth: which Works and Monuments of Piety, ſhew not the Acts of a Tyrant. I ſhall end all with this Eulogy, which a learned Writer gives him. <hi>King</hi> Richard <hi>was a ſtout valiant perſon, ever indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to his People, careful to have their Laws duly obſerved, his making ſo many good ones, if they ſignified not ſome goodneſs in himſelf, were evident arguments of his more then ordinary love to Law and Juſtice.</hi>

               <p>Which he proved to be moſt true in the whole courſe of his life; for having continued priſoner in the Tower three years and a half, the Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> confederating with one <hi>Lambert Simnel,</hi> raiſed an Army againſt the King: the Lieutenant of the Tower favouring their enterpriſe, freely offered the Earl licence to depart out at his pleaſure; which he refuſed, ſaying, <hi>That he that commanded him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould command him out again.</hi> The King underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his fidelity, not onely releaſed him of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. but took him into a more ſpecal regard, and ſoon had he an occaſion to make tryall of him: a great inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction happening in the North, wherein the Rebells were grown ſo potent, that they ſlew the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the field, and took the City of <hi>York</hi> by aſſault; againſt theſe King <hi>Henry</hi> aſſembles a great power making the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> Chief Captain of his Voward; who ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf, that the Rebells forces were diſſipated, their chief Leaders taken, and ſoon after executed. The King noting his great prudence and magnanimity, made
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:116025:92"/>him Lieutenant Generall from <hi>Trent</hi> Northward, had Warden of the Eaſt and middle Marches, and Juſtice of the Forreſts from <hi>Trent</hi> Northwards: in which offices he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſpace of ten years; during which time, the Scots having committed ſome outrages upon the Borders, he made a road into <hi>Tivydale,</hi> where he burnt and deſtroyed all before him: returning with great ſpoils and honour, Not long after he made another road into <hi>Scotland,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with like ſucceſs; <hi>James</hi> the fifth, then King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> raiſed a great power to withſtand him, and ſent to the Earl a challenge to fight with him hand to hand, which he accepted; but the King into his demands, would have the Countrey or Lands then in Controverſie, to be made <hi>Brabium Victoris,</hi> which was without the Earls pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to engage, being the inheritance of the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but he proffers better Lands of his own upon the Combat, which was not accepted, and ſo nothing was concluded.</p>
               <p>A peace being concluded with the Scots, he was called home, and made Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; of the Privy Council, living in great Honor and reputation all the dayes of King <hi>Henry;</hi> who dying, his Son <hi>Henry</hi> that ſucceded him, added to his other dignities, the high Marſhallſhip of <hi>England;</hi> and going in perſon with an Army into <hi>France,</hi> left him Lieutenant Generall from <hi>Trent</hi> Northward, to defend the Realm againſt the Scots: for <hi>James</hi> the Fifth, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> notwithſtanding he were King <hi>Henries</hi> Brother-in-law, yet did ſo firmly adhere to the French, that to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert King <hi>Henries</hi> proceedings, in his own perſon, with a mighty Army he invades <hi>England.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> to oppoſe him raiſes what Forces he could, and at a place called <hi>Flodden</hi> it came to a pitcht field, which was fought with great courage and valour; but God who owned the juſt cauſe of the Engliſh, crowned them with ſucceſs, and ſet the Palm of Victory on the Earl of <hi>Surrey's</hi> head. The

               <p>The Earl for theſe ſervices was by the King at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, highly rewarded, and reſtored to the Dukedom of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> his Fathers Dignity. Soon after was he ſent chief Commiſſioner with the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> the Kings ſiſter, to be married unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King; and after his return home, the King and Queen going to <hi>Guines</hi> to viſit the French King, he was made Protectour of the Realm in his abſence. Old age ſeizing on him, he obtained leave of the King to ſpend the remainder of his dayes at <hi>Fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham</hi> Caſtle, an honourable Manſion of his own; where he continued, and kept a bounteful houſe to the time of his death, which happened in the fourſcore and ſixth year of his age. He was buried at <hi>Thetford</hi> Abbey in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a moſt generous life, worth a large eſtate; ſo clear from debt, that at his death he owed not one groat to any perſon whatſoever: an unuſual happineſs to attend ſo great a Souldier and Courtier as he was.</p>
               <p>From this famous Duke is deſcended the Right Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whoſe great Grandfather <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> married <hi>Margret</hi> ſole Daughter and Heir to Sir <hi>Thomas Audley,</hi> Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>England;</hi> by whom he had iſſue, <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> of <hi>Walden,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who built that magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Structure at <hi>Audley-end,</hi> who left the ſame to his Son and Heir <hi>Theophilus,</hi> a worthy Gentleman, the Father of <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> now living, <hi>Anno</hi> 1659.

               <p>CArdinal <hi>VVolſey</hi> the Tennis-ball, of Fortune was born at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> of ſo poor and deſpicable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that were his ſtory of an ancient date, and not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Authentique Hiſtorians, it might paſs for a fiction; his Father being no more but a poor Butcher: from ſo low a beginning did he riſe to the higheſt pitch of honour.</p>
               <p>His Education in youth was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in <hi>Maudlin</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, from thence he was preferred to be School-maſter to the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſets</hi> Children, where he firſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be imperious over noble blood: the Marqueſs dying, <hi>Wolſey</hi> went into <hi>France</hi> to ſeek his Fortune, and coming to <hi>Callis,</hi> became ſervant to Sir <hi>John Naphant</hi> then Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Town; where he behaved himſelf with ſo great diſcretion, that his Maſter ſhortly preferred him to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
               <p>Having thus caſt Anchor at Court, the Haven of hope, and Port of Promotion, he was more then double diligent in the Kings eye, and very ſerviceable to Doctour <hi>Fox</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheter,</hi> Secretary, and Lord Privy Seal, as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:116025:94"/>alſo to Sir <hi>Thomas Lovel</hi> Maſter of the Wards, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of the Tower, who perſwaded King <hi>Henry</hi> having urgent buſineſs with <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, to ſend <hi>Wolſey</hi> in Embaſſage unto him, being at that preſent in the Countrey of <hi>Flanders;</hi> who returned again before he was thought to be gone, and withal concluded ſome Points for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in his directions, to the hight contentment of King <hi>Henry;</hi> for the which he beſtowed upon him the Deanry of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and not long after made him his Almoner. But King <hi>Henries</hi> day now drawing towards night, he adores the riſing Sun Prince <hi>Henry;</hi> and having found the length of his foot, fitteth him with an eaſie ſhoe, well knowing there could be no loſs to humour him, who was ſo able to give: nor was he deceived in his expectation, for <hi>Henry</hi> afterwards coming to be King, and having conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the City of <hi>Tourney</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> beſtowed the Biſhoprick of the ſame upon <hi>VVolſey;</hi> and not long after made him Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and Archbiſhop of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now being <hi>Primas Anglia,</hi> carried himſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, by erecting his Croſs in the Kings Court, although within the Juriſdiction of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> which high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption <hi>VVilliam</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> greatly checked. But <hi>VVolſey</hi> not abiding any Superious, obtained to be made Prieſt, Cardinal, and <hi>Legatus de Latere,</hi> unto whom the Pope ſent a Cardinals Hat, with certain Bulls for his Authority in that behalf. And now remembring the taunts he had received from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> found means with the King, that he was made Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> which was Chancellour diſmiſſed who had continued in that place long ſince before the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVolſey</hi> now ſitting at the Helm of Church and State, had two Croſſes and two Pillars born ever before him (the one of his Archbiſhoprick, the other of his Legacy) by two of the talleſt Prieſts that were to be found in the Realm. To
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:116025:94"/>the better maintenance of which chargeable eſtate, the King beſtowed on him the Biſhoprick of <hi>VVincheſter;</hi> and in <hi>Commendam,</hi> the Abbey of St. <hi>Albans;</hi> and with them he held in Farm the Biſhopricks of <hi>Bathe, VVorceſter,</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> enjoyed by ſtrangers incumbents, not reſiding in the Realm; ſo that now being Biſhop of <hi>Tourney, Lincolne, York, VVincheſter, Bathe, VVorceſter,</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> he ſeemed a Monſter with ſeven heads, and each of them crowned with the Mitre of a Biſhop; far different from the ſtate of his Lord and Maſter Chriſt, who had not a hole wherein to hide his head.</p>
               <p>Yet his ambition reſteth not here, next he aſpires to the Triple Crown, he onely wants Holineſs, and muſt be Pope; to the attaining of which Dignity he makes means to the Romiſh Cardinals, as alſo to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth: Gold he gave to the Cardinals, and they gave him golden promiſes, although they proved but empty performances; nor did the Emperour ſerve him any better, promiſing much, but performing nothing. <hi>VVolſey</hi> hereat enraged, ſtudies revenge, and by his inſtruments ſeeks to make a divorce betwixt Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> Dowager, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Aunt, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his Maſter, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to advance a Marriage betwixt him and the King of <hi>France's</hi> ſiſter. But though he effected the one, he failed in the other; for contrary to his expectation, King <hi>Henry</hi> fell in love with <hi>Anna Bullen,</hi> a Gentlewoman nothing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to his Pontificial Pomp nor no great follower of the Rites of thoſe times; which moved the Cardinal (the Pope having aſſumed the ſentence of Queen <hi>Katherines</hi> cauſe unto himſelf) to write unto his Holineſs to defer the judgement of Divorce till he had wrought the Kings minde in another mould. But though this was done ſecretly, it came to the Kings ear, and wrought his minde quite off from the Cardinal, which finally was the cauſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: for upon the Kings diſlike, the Counſel articled
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:116025:95"/>againſt him, and the Law found him in a <hi>Premunire,</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to be <hi>Legatus de latere,</hi> and advancing the Popes Power againſt the Laws of the Realm; for which reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Kings diſpleaſure was ſo incenſt, that the Broad Seal was taken from him, and moſt of his other Spiritual Preferments, his houſe and furniture ſeized on to the Kings uſe, and himſelf removed to <hi>Cawood</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> Yet was he ſtill left Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> to which laſt, providing for his inſtalling ſtate equivalent to a Kings Coronation, he was arreſted of high treaſon by the Earl of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> (for words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a deſire of revenge ſaith <hi>Sleidan</hi>) from thence he was conveyed towards <hi>London</hi> by the Lieutenant of the Tower; in which journey, at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Abbey he ended his life, breathing out his ſoul with ſpeeches to his effect. <hi>Had I been as carefull to ſerve the God of Heaven as I have been to comply to the will of my earthly King, God would not have left me in my old age as the other hath done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have imagined he poyſoned himſelf, as not willing to ſurvive his great glory; and ſome have thought he was poyſoned by others, that with his feathers they might build themſelves neſts.

               </q>
               <p>SIr <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> one of the greateſt Ornaments of his time, was a man of thoſe high employments, and of ſo great parts to go thorow them, that he is deſervedly placed amongſt our Engliſh Worthies. He was the Son of Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> Knight, and one of the Juſtices of the Kings Bench, a man ſingular for his many rare perfections. His Birth place was at <hi>Milk-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> the year of our Lord 1480. Having attained ſome skill in the Latine Tongue, Cardinal <hi>Moorton</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Lord High Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> took him into his houſe, where his wit and admirable deportment appeared to be ſuch, that the Cardinall would often ſay of him to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that ſeverall times dined with him, <hi>This Childe here waiting at the Table, whoſoever ſhall live to ſee it, will prove the miracle of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his better proficiency in learning, the Cardinal pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in <hi>Canterbury</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> (now called <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi>) where when he was both in the Greek and Latine Tongue ſufficiently inſtructed, he was then for the ſtudy of the Law put into one of the Innes of Chancery, called <hi>New Inne;</hi> where for his time he highly improved: from thence he removed to <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> where he was made an Utter-Barriſter, where for ſome time he read a Publick Lecture of St. <hi>Auſtine, de Civitate Dei,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> in the Old <hi>Jury.</hi> Afterwards he was made Reader of <hi>Furnivalls-Inne,</hi> where he continued for the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:116025:96"/>ſpace of above three years; after which time he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to his devotions in the <hi>Charter-Houſe</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving religiouſly there for the ſpace of four years.</p>
               <p>Soon after he married the Daughter of Mr. <hi>John Colt</hi> of <hi>New Hall</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> by whom he had one Son and three Daughters; whom from their youth he brought up in vertue and learning. About this time his rare endowments began to be looked upon with a publick eye, which cauſed him to be called to the Bench, and ſoon after choſen a Burgeſs of Parliament, which happenned in the latter end of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths Reign; who demanding one Subſidy and three fifteens for the Marriage of his eldeſt Daughter the Lady <hi>Margret,</hi> unto the King of the Scots; Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> making a grave Speech, argued ſo ſtrongly why theſe exactions were not to be granted, that thereby the Kings demands were fruſtrated, and his requeſt denyed: by which occaſion he fell ſo deeply into the Kings diſpleaſure, that for his own ſafeguard he was determined to have gone over Sea, had not the King ſoon after dyed, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what mittigated his fear, and altered his reſolution.</p>
               <p>After this he was made one of the under Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> by which office and his practice in Law, he gained an eſtate of four hundred pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> Now his learning wiſdom, knowledge, and experience was grown into ſuch note, behaving himſelf ſo admirably, that he gained a general applauſe from all men; and fell into ſuch an eſtimation with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, that he made him maſter of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, ſoon after Knight, and one of his Privy Councel; and ſo from time to time advanced him; continuing ſtill in his ſingular favour and truſty ſervice twenty years and above: his pleaſant diſpoſition and readineſs of wit ſo gaining him into King <hi>Henry's</hi> favour, that upon the death of Mr. <hi>Weſton,</hi> Treaſurer of the Exchequer, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him the office of Treaſurer; and not long after made him Chancellour of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>

               <p>To render his Hiſtory the more pleaſant, take theſe few taſtes of the ſharpneſs of his Wit <hi>Cambden</hi> reports of him that he uſed to compare the great number of women to be choſen for Wives, unto a bag full of Snakes having amongſt them but one Eel; now if a man puts his hand into this bag, he may chance to light on the Eel, but 'tis a hundred to one if he be not ſtung with a Snake.</p>
               <p>Being in company where the maſter of the houſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Beer for the well reliſh of the Hop, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> replyed, but had it hopped a little further, it had hopped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Thames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſuppoſed bribe being put upon Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> a great gilt Cup preſented to him; he being called before the Kings Council to anſwer this accuſation, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he did receive the Cup for a New-years-gift; after ſome importunities he received it, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately he cauſed his Butler to fill it with Wine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in drank to the Gentlewoman that preſented it, and when that ſhe had pledged him, he as freely gave it her again for a New-years gift for her Husband. This great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his accuſation being brought ſcarcely to a little Moſehill.</p>
               <p>When he was Juſtice of Peace he uſed to go to the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at <hi>New Gate,</hi> where one of the Ancienteſt Juſtice of Peace of the Bench was uſed to chide perſons when their Purſes had been cut, for not being more carefull; telling them, that their negligence was the cauſe that ſo many Cut-purſes were brought thirther. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> obſ rving him to repeat this caution ſo often, ſent for one of the chiefeſt Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſes that was in priſon, and promiſed him to ſave him harmleſs if he would but cut the ſaid Juſtices Purſe the next day as he ſat on the Bench, and when he had done to make a ſign of it to him. The day after when they ſat again, the Thief was called one of the firſt; who being accuſed of the fact, ſaid, he did not doubt but that he could ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:116025:97"/>himſelf, if he were permitted to ſpeak to ſome of the Bench in private: Being bid to chuſe whom he would, he chuſe the grave old Juſtice, who then had his pouch at his girdle, as they wore them in thoſe dayes; and whileſt that he whiſpers him in the ear, he ſlily cuts his purſe. Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> knowing by the ſign that the buſineſs was diſpatcht, preſently took occaſion to move the Bench to diſtribute ſome alms upon a poor needy fellow that was there, and for example ſake began firſt himſelf; the old Juſtice when he lookt for his purſe found it cut away; and much wondering, ſaid, He was confident he brought it with him. Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> replyed pleaſantly, What will you charge any of us with Felony? The Juſtice's colour riſing (as he was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) he calls the Cut-purſe, and bids him give him his purſe again; and withal adviſed the good old Juſtice hereafter not to be ſo bitter a cenſurer of other innocent mens negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when as himſelf could not ſecure his purſe in that open Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>It chanced another time, that a Beggars little Dog which ſhe had loſt was ſent to the Lady <hi>Moor</hi> for a preſent, ſhe kept it a week being much pleaſed and delighted with it; but at laſt the Beggar having notice where her Dog was, came and complained to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> as he was ſitting in his Hall at <hi>Chelſey,</hi> that his Lady kept her Dog from her: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently my Lady was ſent for, and the Dog brought with her; which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> taking in his arms, he cauſed his Wife to ſtand at the upper end of the Hall, and the Beggar at the lower end. Then ſaying that he ſate there to do every one juſtice, he bad each of them call the Dog; which when they did, the Dog ran preſently to the Beggar, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking his Wife; which when he ſaw, he deſired her to be contented, for it was none of hers: yet ſhe repining at the ſentence, he agreed with the Beggar, and gave her a piece of Gold.

               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> demanding his money of one that was in his debt, ſpake this ſentence in Latine to Sir <hi>Thomas Moor, Memento morieris;</hi> to which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> preſently replied, What ſay you, Sir, <hi>Memento Mori aeris,</hi> Remember <hi>Mores</hi> money.</p>
               <p>It is alſo ſtoried of him, that whereas upon Holy Dayes during his High Chancellourſhip, one of his Gentlemen when Service was done at Church uſed to come to his Ladies Pew, and ſay, Madam, my Lord is gone. The next Holy Day after his ſurrender of his office of Chancellourſhip, and putting off his former retinue of Gentlemen, he came to his Wives Pew himſelf, and making a low congee, ſaid, Madam, my Lord is gone.</p>
               <p>It is further reported of him, that when he was ſent by his Maſter <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth into <hi>Germany,</hi> that a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he delivered his Embaſſage to the Emperour, he bid one of his ſervants to fill him a Beer-glaſſe of wine, which he drunk off twice, commanding his ſervant to bring him a third; he knowing Sir <hi>Thomas Moors</hi> tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he was not uſed to drink, at the firſt refuſed to fill him another, as he told Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> of the weight of his employment: But his ſervant not daring to deny his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the third glaſs, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> made his immediate addreſs to the Emperour, and ſpake his Oration in Latine, to the admiration of all the Auditours. Afterwards Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> merrily asking his man what he thought of his ſpeech, he ſaid, that he deſerved to govern three parts of the World, and he believed if he had drunk the other glaſs, the Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Language might have purchaſed the other part of the World.</p>
               <p>Another time a certain Friend of his preſented him with a Book which he intended to publiſh, (being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of his own Wit, which no body elſe thought worth the reading) becauſe he would Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould overſee it ere it were printed, he brought it to him; who peruſing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:116025:98"/>it, and finding nothing therein worthy the Preſs, ſaid with a grave countenance, <hi>If it were in Verſe, it would deſerve better.</hi> Upon which words he went and turned it into verſe, &amp; then brought it again to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> who looking thereon ſaid ſoberly, <hi>Yea marry, now it is ſomewhat; for it is Rime now, before it was neither Rime nor Reaſon.</hi> Infinite are the conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expreſſions that continually fell from him.</p>
               <p>But to return from whence we have digreſt, during the time he was Chancellour of the Dutchy, he was twice made Ambaſſadour, joyned in Commiſſion with Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> once to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> the other time to the French King into <hi>France.</hi> Being once at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where an arrogant fellow had ſet up a Theſis, that he would anſwer any queſtion could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto him in what Art ſoever: Of whom when Sir <hi>Tho. Moor</hi> heard, he laughed, and made this Queſtion to be put up for him to anſwer, Whether <hi>Averia capta in Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namia ſunt irreplegebilia:</hi> adding, that there was one of the Engliſh Ambaſſadours Retinue that would thereof diſpute with him. This bragging <hi>Thraſo,</hi> not ſo much as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe Terms of our Common Law, knew not what to anſwer to it; and ſo he became ridiculous to the whole City for his preſumptuous bragging.</p>
               <p>The Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> being now void, Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly ſeeketh for the place, but by means of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was diſappointed; whereupn the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal (as we have recorded in his Life) to be revenged on the Emperour, and to ingratiate himſelf with the French King, endeavours a Divorce betwixt King <hi>Henry</hi> and Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> Aunt to the Emperour, thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him to match with the French Kings ſiſter. And for the better accompliſhing therof, he requeſted <hi>Longland</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and Ghoſtly Father to the King, to put a ſcruple into the Kings head, that it was not lawful for him to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Brothers Wife: which the King not ſorry to hear
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:116025:98"/>of, opened it firſt to Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> whoſe counſel he required therein, of purpoſe quoting certain places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſeemed to ſerve his turn.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> unwilling to diſpleaſe the King by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his opinion, began to excuſe himſelf (as one that had never profeſt the ſtudy of Divinity) to be every way unfit to meddle with ſuch matters; the King not ſatisfied with this anſwer, ſtill preſſed upon him ſo ſore for it, that in concluſion he condeſcended to his requeſt. And further, becauſe the buſineſs was of ſuch weight and importance, as required adviſement, and good deliberation, he beſought his Grace that he would give him ſufficient time ſeriouſly to conſider it; wherewith the King very well contented, told him that <hi>Tunſtal</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Bathe,</hi> with others the moſt learned of his privy Councel, ſhould alſo confer with him therein.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> departing, compared thoſe places of Scripture with the Expoſitions of divers of the old Doctors; and at his next coming to the Court, diſcourſing to his Majeſty his opinion of the foreſaid matter, he ſaid, <hi>To be plain with your Grace, neither my Lord of</hi> Durham, <hi>nor my Lord of</hi> Bathe, <hi>(though I know them both to be wiſe, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, learned and honourable Prelates) nor my ſelf with the reſt of your Councel, (being all of us your Majeſties own Servants, ſo much bound unto your Highneſs for your great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours daily beſtowed upon us) be, in my judgement, meet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours for your Grace herein; but if your Highneſs pleaſe to underſtand the very truth, you may have ſuch Counſellours elected, as neither for reſpect of their own worldly profit, nor for fear of your Princely diſpleaſure, will be inclined to partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> He then quoted Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and divers other Fathers and Holy Doctours, both Greek and Latine, ſhewing what authority he had gathered out of them for what he ſaid; which although it was againſt the grain, not ſo pleaſant to the King, as not agreeing to his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:116025:99"/>deſires; yet Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> (had in all his communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the King in this buſineſs) ſo diſcreetly demeaned himſelf, that at that preſent the King did not diſtaſte what he ſaid, and often afterwards had conference with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame caſe of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>For the further tryal and examination of this Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcruple, a Commiſſion was ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> in which Cardinal <hi>Campeius</hi> and Cardinall <hi>Wolſey</hi> were joyned Commiſſioners; who for the determination thereof ſate at <hi>Black Fryers</hi> in <hi>London:</hi> the King and Queen being cited to appear before them. In the proſecution of which buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, the King took ſuch diſtaſte at <hi>Wolſey,</hi> that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed him of his office of Lord Chancellour, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame on Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> the better to draw him to his ſide; but he valuing more the quiet of his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then any Princes honour in the world, fell down on his knees, deſiring his Majeſties favour to employ him in any Affair, in which with integrity of his Conſcience he might truly ſerve God and him: to which the King curteouſly anſwered, that if he could not therein with his Conſcients ſerve, he was content to accept of his ſervice otherwiſe, and take the advice of other his learned Council, whoſe conſciences would well enough diſpenſe with it; yet that he would nevertheleſs continue his wonted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards him, and no more moleſt or trouble his minde with that buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Upon Sir <hi>Thomas Moors</hi> entrance into this laſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preferment, every one might perceive a very ſtrange alteration: for whereas the precedent Chancellour <hi>Wolſey</hi> would ſcarce look or ſpeak to any, into whoſe onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence none could be admitted unleſs his fingers were tipp'd with Gold; on the contrary, this Chancellour, the poorer and meaner the Suppliant was, the more affable he was to him, and the more attentively he would hearken to his cauſe, and with ſpeedy tryal diſpatch him; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:116025:99"/>he uſed commonly every afternoon to fit in his Hall, that if any perſon whatſoever had any ſuit unto him, they might the more boldly come to his preſence, and open their complaints before him, and find ſudden redreſs. It is reported of him that whereas our pick pocket Lawyers with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winded Chancery Demurrs, to the undoing of thouſands; keep off buſineſs, his practice was, if it were to be done with conveniency, to diſpatch a Cauſe at the firſt hearing; for which reaſon a Writer wittily calls him Sir <hi>Thomas Plus;</hi> becauſe before he roſe off from the Bench, he alwayes uſed to ask if there were any more Cauſes. Thus the greatneſs of honour, the change of his place altered him not; Sir <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> remained ſtill the ſame good man that he was, his humility was the ſame. It being obſerved of him, that every day as he paſſed through the Hall to his place in the Chancery, by the Court of the Kings Bench, where his Father was one of the Judges, that he would go into the Court, and there reverently kneeling down, in the fight of them all, duly ask his Father Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely add one ſtory more concerning his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the height of his honour; the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a time to <hi>Chelſey</hi> to dine with him, happened to find him in the Church ſinging in the Quire, with a ſurplice on his back; to whom after Service as they went homeward hand in hand together, the Duke ſaid, <hi>Gods Body, my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, what a Pariſh Clerk a Pariſh Clerk; you diſhonour the King and his Office: nay,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſmiling upon the Duke, <hi>Your Grace may not think your maſter and mine will be offended with me for ſerving of God his Maſter, of thereby count his office diſhonoured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proceed, King <hi>Henry</hi> determining to marry the Lady <hi>Anne Cleve,</hi> for his better proceeding in this affair called a Parliament, where he with the Biſhops and Nobles of the upper Houſe, were commanded by the King to go down to the Commons, to ſhew unto them both what the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:116025:100"/>as well of other parts beyond the Seas, as at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> had done therein; their Seals alſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying the ſame; all which at the Kings requeſt (not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what judgement himſelf was therein) he declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lower Houſe: yet doubting leaſt further attempts ſhould after follow, which contrary to his Conſcience (by reaſon of his office) he was likely to be put unto, he made ſuit unto the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> his ſingular dear friend, to be a means to the King, that he might with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties favour be diſcharged of that chargeable office of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellourſhip; wherein for certain infirmities of his body, he pretended himſelf unable any longer to ſerve. To which purpoſe the Duke ſolliciting the King, obtained of him a clear diſcharge from the ſame, with thanks and praiſe for his worthy ſervice herein. And not underſervedly, his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, nobleneſs, and charity being ſo great that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he had gone thorow ſo many offices for almoſt twenty years, he was not able to purchaſe more then one hundred pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Touching his troubles, they began firſt by occaſion of a certain Nun dwelling in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who affirmed that ſhe had revelations from God to give the King warning of his wicked life, and of the abuſe of the Sword and Authority committed to him. This Nun conferring with Biſhop <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> about the ſame, they adviſed her to go to the King her ſelf, and to let him underſtand the whole circumſtance thereof: whereupon at the Parliament following, there was a Bill put into the lower Houſe, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tache the Nun with divers other Religious perſons of High Treaſon, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> Sir <hi>Thowas Moor,</hi> and ſome others of miſpriſion of Treaſon. Divers other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations came thick and threefold upon him; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs had he not been one of a ſingular integrity, and free from all corruption of wrong doing, or bribes taking, theſe accuſations had overwhelmed him: but they all falling
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:116025:100"/>ſhort of the miſchievous deſign that was on foot againſt him, a trick was found not to take him off, which thoſe that contrived it were certain could not but take, as they knew that he was of ſo tender a conſcience as that they could not fail of their project; he was cited to appear at <hi>Lambeth</hi> before the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and Secretary <hi>Cromwell,</hi> to take the oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and Succeſſion; which he refuſing, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cuſtody of the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for four dayes, and afterwards, by the importunity of Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> to the Tower.</p>
               <p>Whereat his landing, Mr. Lieutenant was ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, the Porter of the Tower demanded of him his upper Garment, <hi>Mr. Porter,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>here it is;</hi> and took off his Cap and gave it him, ſaying, <hi>I am ſorry it is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee:</hi> no Sir, ſaid the Porter, <hi>I muſt have your Gown,</hi> which he gave him. This his pleaſantneſs certainly argued a confidence he had in the juſtneſs of his cauſe.</p>
               <p>After many endeavours during his abode in the Tower, to get his conſent to the taking of the Oath, all which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fruitleſs, after a years impriſonment, he was called to his arraignment at the Kings Bench Bar, where his Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being read, he pleaded not guilty; and to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the hearers, ſo quitted himſelf, that he put the Bench to a ſtand; untill at the laſt one Mr. <hi>Rich</hi> the Kings Solliciter depoſited againſt him, that he ſhould ſay, <hi>The Parliament could make the King no more Supreme Head of Church, then they could make a Law that God ſhould not be God.</hi> To which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwered, <hi>If I were a man my Lords, that did not regard an oath, I need not at this time in this place (as it is well known to you all) ſtand as an accuſed perſon. And if this oath</hi> (Mr. <hi>Rich) which you have taken be true, then I pray that I may never ſee God in the Face, which I would not ſay were it otherwiſe to gain the whole world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding his oath, and the exceptions he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:116025:101"/>took againſt the witneſs, the Lord Chancellour proceeded to ſentence, That he ſhould be brought back to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>London,</hi> by the help of <hi>William Bringſton</hi> Sheriff, and from thence drawn on a Hurdle through the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to <hi>Tyburne,</hi> there to be hanged till he be half dead, after that cut down yet alive, his Privy Parts cut off, his Belly ripped, his Bowels burnt, and his four quarters ſet up over four Gates of the City, and his head upon <hi>London Bridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Sentence was by the Kings pardon changed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into onely beheading, becauſe he had borne the higheſt Office in the Kingdom. Of which mercy of the Kings, word being brought to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> he anſwered merrily, God <hi>forbid the King ſhould uſe any more ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to any of my poſterity or friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time he remained in the Tower after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſed on him, one of the Court came to viſit him, whoſe whole diſcourſe was nothing elſe, but urging Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to change his minde; who at laſt being wearied with his importunity, anſwered him, That he had changed it. Whreupon preſently he went and told the King; and being by him commanded to know wherein his minde was changed, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> rebuked him for his inconſiderate raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he ſhould tell the King thoſe words that he ſpoke in jeaſt, onely to be rid of his impertinency; meaning a while after this merry expreſſion came from him, that whereas he intended to be ſhaved, (for which he was ſaid ſo much to reſembled <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) that he might appear to the people as before, he now reſolved that his beard ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the ſame tribulation he did; which made the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier blank and the King very angry. The day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his execution being come, about nine of the Clock he was brought out of the Tower, aſcending the Scaffold, it ſeemed ſo weak that it was ready to fall; whereupon he ſaid merrily to the Lieutenant, <hi>I pray you Mr. Lieutenant ſee me ſafe up, and for my coming down let me ſhift for my
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:116025:101"/>ſelf.</hi> Then deſired he all the people to pray for him, and to bear witneſs with him, that he ſhould then ſuffer death, in, and for the Faith of the Holy Catholique Church, a faithfull ſervant both of God and the King. Which done, he kneeled down, and after his prayers ended, he turned to the Executioner, and with a chearful countenance, ſaid, <hi>Pluck up thy ſpirits man, and be not afraid to do thine Office, my neck is very ſhort, take heed therefore thou ſtrike not awry for ſaving thine honeſty:</hi> then laying his head upon the Block, he bad the Executioner ſtay untill he had removed aſide his Beard, ſaying, <hi>That that had never committed any Treaſon.</hi> So with much chearfulneſs he received the Fatall blow of the Ax, which at once ſevered his head from his body. This jeaſt at his death the Catholiques ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſted, that at ſo ſerious a time he ſhould be ſo airy and light, that he had almoſt been ſcratched out of their Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization for a Saint. He was executed the ſixth day of <hi>July,</hi> following the decollation of Biſhop <hi>Fiſher,</hi> who was for the ſame Cauſe beheaded on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi> The Life of this Biſhop is extant, incomparable well done by Doctor <hi>Bailie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus died Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> a man admirable in all kinde of learning , Latine, Greek, Prophane, Divine: his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> is admired over the world; his <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, till of late years, of ſo much credit with Hiſtorians, that they have placed it in their Works without the alteration of a word. He was of ſuch excellency of Wit and Wiſdom, that he was able to make his fortune good in what place ſoever he lived; who wanted no skill either for the mannaging of private or publick buſineſſes, being experienced both in Countrey and City Affairs; in giving ſolid and ſound counſel in doubtful caſes, none more prudent; to tell the truth without fear, none more free; as from all flatteries he was open and pleaſant, full of grace in delivering his judgement. And to conclude, one, whoſe integrity made him a miracle of nature, whiſt he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:116025:102"/>was living, and whoſe Books have made him an everlaſting Monument now he is dead. He was behead in the year 1535. his Monument is in <hi>Chelſey</hi> Church, where it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> lies buried with him in the ſame Grave; that as they ſuffered for one Opinion, it was thought fit they ſhould not be parted.</p>

                  <hi>THomas Cromwell,</hi> from ſo low a beginning, as from the Forge, attained to ſo high a pitch of honour, as to be raiſed to a Pillar of State.</p>
               <p>His Father, as our Chronicles report, was a Blackſmith, to whom may be applied what <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſaid of <hi>Demoſthenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Whom his poor Father, blear-eye'd with the ſoot</l>
                  <l>Of ſparks, which from the burning Iron did ſhoot,</l>
                  <l>From Coals, Tongs, Anvil, and ſuch Black-ſmiths tools,</l>
                  <l>And dirty Forge ſent to the Rhetrick Schools.</l>
               </q>
               <p>He was born at <hi>Putney</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> four miles from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> being endued with a ſingular excellency of Wit. His firſt advancement was under Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> who made him his Solliciter, employing him for the ſuppreſſion of forty Monaſteries, to the erection of his Colledges at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> At the fall of the Cardinal he got him to Court, where he was by King <hi>Henry</hi> firſt advanced to be Maſter of his Jewel-houſe, then Barron of <hi>Oakham</hi> in <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landſhire,</hi> then Knight of the Garter; ere long he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> then made Lord great Chamberlain, and laſtly ordained the Kings Vicar General over the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality; by vertue of which Office he ſat in the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-houſe, as Head over the Biſhops: an Honour ſo great, that never any ſubject enjoyed the like in <hi>England. Dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> thus epitomizes his Honours,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Firſt by my Knighthood, riſing by degree,</l>
                  <l>The Office of a Jewel-houſe my lot;</l>

                  <l>After the Robes he frankly gave to me,</l>
                  <l>From whence to Privy Councellour I got:</l>
                  <l>Then of the Garter, and then Earl to be</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> yet ſufficient theſe were not,</l>
                  <l>But to the great Vicegerency I drew,</l>
                  <l>Being a Title as ſupream as new,</l>
               </q>
               <p>And now finding by <hi>Wolſey's</hi> predicting fall, that the foundations of Monaſteries were not unmoveable; he puts it into the King head to have them all ſuppreſſed, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not long before declared ſupream Head of the Church, thought his ſtate in danger, ſo long as the Pope had ſuch Pillars to uphold his Power. Another main thing was their exceſſive Riches, which was valued at the yearly ſum of 1865 12. pounds, 8. ſhillings, 1. d. o. q. beſides the two Univerſities, and divers Monaſteries, which were unvalued. And no wonder that Bell ſounded ſo ſweetly in the Kings ear, when ſo much profit pull'd the rope: what ever was the true cauſe, the pretended cauſe was the gain that was got by ignorant devotion, and gadding on Pilgrimage; as likewiſe that they were the receptacles of all traiterous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt the peace of the Land, and Supremacy of the Crown. Beſides the Whoredoms, Adulteries, Inceſts, and filthy Sodomies of the Monks, Friers, and Prieſts, which put together weighed ſo heavy, that by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament they were granted all to the Kings uſe, and Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſent forth for the Bible in Engliſh to be read in all Churches, and Regiſter-books of Weddings, Chriſtenings, and Burials in every of them to be kept.</p>
               <p>Theſe Actions of the King exaſperated many, eſpecially the Pope, who feared his <hi>Dagon</hi> would down, if the King ſhould be acknowledged ſupream Head of the Church; whereupon he pronounceth him an Heretick, and ſeduceth (amongſt others) <hi>James</hi> the Fifth King of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt him. <hi>Cromwel</hi> that his Maſter might be able to bandy with the Pope, counſelleth him to allie himſelf with ſome Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:116025:104"/>Princeſs; the King then a widdower entertained the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a marriage is concluded betwixt him and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Anne,</hi> Siſter to <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Cleve,</hi> whoſe other Siſter <hi>Fredrick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> had eſpouſed, a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the Goſpel, and maintainer of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> the promulgator and profeſſour thereof. But the Lady ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and married to King <hi>Henry,</hi> found but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affection from him, which <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> perceiving, thought it a fit ſubject for him to work upon againſt the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the firſt contriver of the match; for being in his heart a great ſtickler for the Pope, he reſolved to make uſe of the times. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Kings ſupremacy, he perſwaded the King that his reformation of Religion would ſet all the Princes of Chriſtendome againſt him; and at laſt prevailed ſo far with him, that he conſented to have ſix Articles enacted by Parliament, which according as we finde them, we have here tranſcribed to poſterity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That after the words of confirmation ſpoken by the Prieſt, the real and natural body and blood of Chriſt, as he was Conceived and Crucified, was in the Sacrament, and no other ſubſtance conſiſting in the form of Bread and Wine, beſides the ſubſtance of Chriſt, God, and man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the communion in both kindes was not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto ſalvation, the fleſh onely in the form of Bread ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Laity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Prieſts after they had received Orders might not marry by the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the vows of Chaſtity either in man or Woman, ought by Gods Law to be obſerved, and by which they are exempted from other Liberties of Chriſtian people.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That private Maſſes was neceſſary for the people, and agreeable to the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That Auricular Confeſſion was expedient to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and continued in the Church of God.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:116025:104"/>
               <p>By this we ſee the King left the ſting of Popery ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, though the teeth were knockt out by aboliſhing the Popes ſupremacy; the effect of which bloody Articles the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſoon felt, for the King having by him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his ends, and filled his Coffers with the Abbeys wealth, left him to the malice of his inveterate enemies. Whereupon a Parliament being ſummoned, <hi>Cromwell</hi> being in the Council Chamber was ſuddenly apprehended, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted priſoner to the Tower: the Crimes objected againſt him were theſe. Firſt, he was accuſed of Hereſie, and a ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Hereticks Secondly, that he had diſperſed amongſt the Kings Subjects many Books containing much Hereſie in them. Thirdly, that he had cauſed many Books to be Tranſlated into Engliſh, comprizing matter againſt the Sacrament of the Altar, and that he had commended it a good and Chriſtian Doctrine. Fourthly, that he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken words againſt the King. Whileſt he remained in the Tower, ſome Commiſſioners coming to examine him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them with ſuch diſcretion, as ſhewed him to be of a ſound judgement, and as able to defend, as they to accuſe. Amongſt the Commiſſioners there was one whom the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> deſired to carry from him a Letter to the King, which he refuſed, ſaying, <hi>That he would carry no Letter to the King from a Traytor:</hi> then he deſired him at the leaſt to carry a meſſage from him to the King, which requeſt he aſſemted to, ſo it were not againſt his Allegiance; then the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> taking witneſs of the other Lords what he had promiſed, <hi>You ſhall</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>commend me to the King, and tell him, by that time he hath tried and proved you as I have done, he ſhall finde you as falſe a man as ever came about him.</hi> But his enemies knowing his innocency, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, durſt not bring him to his anſwer, nor try him by his Peers, but procured an Act of Attaindure, whereby he was condemned before he was heard. For the better illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Hiſtory, before I ſhall acquaint you with his <hi>exit,</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:116025:105"/>I thought it not improper to inſert an example of his Generoſity and Gratitude, as I have it from Doctour <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> in his Apology, in theſe words.</p>
               <p>In thoſe glorious dayes, when the Engliſh young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try endeavoured to out-vie their elder Brothers, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking far and dangerous journies into Forreign Parts, to acquire glory by feats of Arms, and experiencing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Military Diſcipline, <hi>Thomas Cromwel</hi> a youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother, to better his knowledge in Warlike Affairs, paſſed into <hi>France,</hi> and there trailed a Pike, accompanying the French Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> where they were defeated at <hi>Gattellion;</hi> whereupon our Engliſh Volantier betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Florence,</hi> deſigning to paſs thence home again into <hi>England:</hi> but having loſt all his equipage, and being in a neceſſitated condition, he was enforced to addreſs himſelf to one <hi>Signior Franciſco Freſcobald</hi> an Italian Merchant, who correſponded at <hi>London;</hi> and making his caſe known unto him, <hi>Freſcobald</hi> obſerving ſomething remarkable, and a certain promiſing greatneſs in the Features, Actions, and Deportment of <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> who gave an account of himſelf with ſo candid an ingenuity, and in ſuch terms as beſeemed his Birth, and the Profeſſion he then was of: whereby he gained ſo much upon <hi>Freſcobald,</hi> as inviting him home to his houſe, he cauſed him to be accommodated with new Linnen and Clothes, and other ſutable neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; kindly entertaining him, till ſuch time as he teſtified a deſire to return for <hi>England;</hi> when as to compleat his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and Kindeneſs, he gave Mr. <hi>Tho. Cromwell</hi> a Horſe, and 16. duccats in gold, to proſecute his journey homewards.</p>
               <p>In proceſs of time, ſeveral Diſaſters and Bankrupts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling <hi>Signior Freſcobald,</hi> his Trading and Credit was not a little thereby impaired; and reflecting on the Moneys which were due unto him by his Correſpondents in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the value of 15000. Duccats he reſolved to paſs thither, and try whether he could happily procure payment.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:116025:105"/>
               <p>During which interval of time, Mr. <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> being a perſon endowed with a great deal of Courage, of a tranſcendent Wit, hardy in his undertakings, and a great Politician, had by theſe his good qualities gotten himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and credit at Court, and highly ingratiated himſelf with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; having advanced himſelf to almoſt as high a pitch of Honour, in as ſhort a time, in a manner, as his late Highneſs did.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> therefore riding one day with a great Train of Noble Men towards the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, chanced to eſpy on foot in the ſtreets <hi>Signior Freſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobald,</hi> the Italian Merchant, in an ill plight: however, he immediately alighting from his Horſe, embraced him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world, to the great aſtoniſhment of the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and chid him, that at his very arrival he came not to viſit him. <hi>Freſcobald</hi> being aſtoniſhed at ſo unexpected an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and receiving ſo ſignal a favor from a Perſonage he could not call to mind he had ever known, was quite ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; &amp; my Lord <hi>Cromwells</hi> preſſing Affairs at Court not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him the while to acquaint him further who he was, only engaged him to come and dine with him that day. <hi>Freſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobald</hi> full of amazement, enquired of the Attendants who that great Perſonage might be? And hearing his name, he began to call the Feature of his Face, and the Idea of his Perſon to minde; and ſo by degrees conceiving with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf it might happily be the ſame Mr. <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> whom he had harboured at <hi>Florence;</hi> he enquired out his Lordſhips habitation, and attended his coming at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, walking in his Court-yard. No ſooner was the Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> entred the ſame (attended by ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, and Officers of the Crown) but ſpeedily alighting from his Horſe, he embraced his Friend <hi>Freſcobald</hi> in the ſame manner he had done in the morning; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the Lords which accompanied him were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at ſuch a diſproportioned familiarity, he told them
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:116025:106"/>that he was more obliged to <hi>Freſcobald,</hi> then to all the men in the world, owing unto him the making of his Fortune; and ſo proceeded to relate unto them the whole ſtory which had befallen him at <hi>Florence.</hi> So great a delight do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mindes take to recount their foregoing Misfortunes, when their Grandor hath elevated them to ſuch a pitch, as that they triumph over ſhame, and are incapable of Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Freſcobald</hi> was treated at Dinner with all the tenderneſs he could expect from ſo great a Perſonage, and ſo great a Friend, after which being carried up by the Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> into his Cloſet, he was there preſented with four Bags of Gold, each containing four hundred Duccats, in return of his former Civilities: which <hi>Freſcobald</hi> (being of a gallant ſpirit) at firſt refuſed, but after ſeverall conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations was conſtrained to accept, as an acknowledgement from the Lord <hi>Cromwell;</hi> who, moreover enquiring of him concerning his coming over, and Affairs in <hi>England;</hi> and underſtanding his Loſſes, and that there were Moneys due to him, cauſed him to write down his Debters names; and by his Secretary ſummoned the ſeverall Merchants which were indebted to <hi>Freſcobald</hi> (upon pain of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure) to clear their Accounts with him, and to pay him within the ſpace of fifteen dayes; which was accordingly performed: onely <hi>Freſcobald</hi> freely forgave them the uſe.</p>
               <p>Over and above all which, the Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> endeavoured to perſwade his Friend <hi>Freſcobald</hi> to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in <hi>England</hi> the reſt of his dayes, proferring to lend him a Stock of 60000. Duccats, to trade withall: But <hi>Freſcobald</hi> being over-charged with all thoſe grand Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> had conferred on him; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by his Lordſhips Generoſity acquired enough to keep him from being neceſſitated all his life time; and deeming that the trading in good Works was incomparably more ſure and gainful then in the richeſt Wares and Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:116025:106"/>being reſolved to quit Trading, and to end the reſt of his dayes peaceably and quietly, he obtained leave of the Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> to depart to his own Countrey, freighted with ſo great obligations as cauſed in him a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſhame. He afterwards arrived ſafe in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where with great reputation he dyed in a good old age.</p>
               <p>Having done him this honour to eternize the noble deportments of his life, I ſhall now end with a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what he ſaid at his death.</p>
               <p>When he came upon the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his minde to the people; <hi>I am come hither to die, and not to purge my ſelf, as ſome perhaps may expect that I ſhould, and will; for if I ſhould ſo do, I were a very wretch: I am by the Law condemned to die, and I thank my Lord God that hath appointed me this death for mine offence; for I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lived a ſinner, and offended my Lord God, for which I ask him hearty forgiveneſs. Its not unknown to many of you, that I was a great Traveller, and being but of mean Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, was called to high honours, and now I have offended my Prince, for which I heartily ask him forgiveneſs, beſeeching you to pray with me to almighty God, that he will forgive me,</hi> &amp;c. Then kneeling down on his knees, he made a long and pithy prayer, which being ended, after a godly exhortation to thoſe on the Scaffold, he commended his Spirit into the hands of his Maker: his head being diſſevered from his body, <hi>July</hi> 28 1540. The King not long after his death, clapping his hands on his breaſt, repented this haſte, wiſhing that he had his <hi>Cromwell</hi> alive again. With him was behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord <hi>Hungerford</hi> of <hi>Heitesbury,</hi> who ſuffered death, a juſt death for buggery. Without queſtion <hi>Cromwell</hi> was a perſon of ſingular qualifications, unfortunate in nothing more then that he lived in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; of whom, if it could be poſſible, one writes, that for the time he Reigned, he was guilty of more Tyranny then any of the Roman Emperours. This great Stateſman was condemned
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:116025:107"/>to death, and yet never came to his anſwer, by an act (as it is ſaid) which he himſelf cauſed to be made; of which Mr. <hi>Michael Drayton</hi> thus writes.</p>

His Mother was Daughter to Sir <hi>John Dudley</hi> Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and Siſter to the Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> ſo that his deſcent was apparently noble of both ſides. <hi>Verſtigan</hi> ſayes the <hi>Sidney's</hi> are of a French extraction, that they came over into <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Thirds dayes. In his very childe-hood there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him ſuch excellent parts and endowments of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſhewed him born for high enterpriſes; having been educated in the principles of learning at home, he was ſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford, Cambridge</hi> being nevertheleſs ſo happy to have a Colledge of his name, where he ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in the Arts and Sciences, that after an incredible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in all the ſpecies of Learning, he left the Accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical life, for that of the Court; whither he came by the invitation of his Uncle, the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> of whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:116025:108"/>he was; a great favourite of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> he was of a comely preſence, framed by a naturall propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to arms, and Warlike atchievements; ſo that he ſoon attracted the good opinion of all men, eſpecially of the Queen, fame having already blazed abroad his admirable parts; ſhe thought him fit for the greateſt employments, ſent him upon an Embaſſy to the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which he diſcharged to his own honour, and her approbation. Yea, his fame was ſo renowned throughout all Chriſtendom, that he was in election for the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> and elective Kingdom: but the Queen refuſed to further his advancement, not out of emulation, but for the loſs of his company at Court. He married Sir <hi>Francis Walſingams</hi> Daughter, who impoveriſhed himſelf to enrich the State; from whom he expected no more then what was above all portions, a Beautifull Wife, and a Vertuous Daughter.</p>
               <p>During his abode at the Court, at his ſpare hours he compoſed that incomparable Romance, entituled, <hi>The Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> which he ded icated to his Siſter the Counteſs of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke.</hi> A Book, which conſidering his ſo Youthfull Years, and Martial Employments, it was a wonder that he had leaſure for to write ſuch a Volumn: which as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> the Learned Ornament of our Nation in his exquiſite Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography writes thus of. Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> of whom ſayes he, I cannot make too honourable a mention, and of his <hi>Arcadia,</hi> a Book which beſides its excellent Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, rare Contrivance, and delectable Stories, hath in it all the ſtrains of Poeſie, comprehendeth the whole Art of Speaking, and to them who can deſcern and will obſerve, affordeth notable Rules of Demeanour, both private and publick. One writes that Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> in the extream agony of his wounds, ſo terrible the ſenſe of Death is, that he requeſted the deareſt Friend he had living to burn his <hi>Arcadia.</hi> On which one Epigrammatiſt writes thus.</p>

               <p>Yet was he not altogether addicted to Arts, but given as much to the Exerciſe of Arms, being a follower of <hi>Mars</hi> as well as a Friend to the Muſes; and although he himſelf uſed to ſay, <hi>That Eaſe was the Nurſe of Poeſie,</hi> yet his Life made it manifeſt, that the Muſes inhabited the Fields of <hi>Mars,</hi> as well as the flowery Lawns of <hi>Arcadia;</hi> that Sonnets were ſung in the Tents of War, as well as in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:116025:110"/>the Courts of Peace; the Muſes Layes being warbled forth by a Warlike <hi>Sidney</hi> in as high a tune, as ever they were ſung by a peaceable <hi>Spenſer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although the lamp of his life was extinguiſht too ſoon, yet left he a ſufficient teſtimony to the world what he would have been, had the Fates allowed him a longer life. Witneſs ſuch time when the French Ambaſſadours came over into <hi>Englad,</hi> to negotiate a Marriage between the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> when for their entertainment a ſolemn Juſts was proclaimed, where the Earl of <hi>Arundel, Frederick</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> Sir <hi>Foulk Grivel,</hi> and he, were chief Challengers againſt all commers; in which challenge he behaved himſelf ſo gallantly, that he wan the reputation of a moſt valiant Knight.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Netherlanders oppreſſed with the tyanny of the Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> implored the aſſiſtance of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> which matter being debated in Councel, ſhe condeſcended to become their Defendreſs; and thereupon Articles being drawn, five thouſand Foot, and a thouſand Horſe-men were ſent under the command of Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> a renowned Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, all retained at her Majeſties pay, which monethly amounted to twelve thouſand five hundred twenty ſix pound Sterling, accounting fifty ſix dayes to the moneth. For which Moneys ſo disburſed, the Towns of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Brill,</hi> with two Sconces, and the Caſtle of <hi>Ramekins</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> were delivered as Pledges till the Money was repaid. Over <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Ramekins</hi> was Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> appointed Governour: His Motto was, <hi>Vix ea noſtra voco,</hi> who during thoſe Wars behaved himſelf, being entred into the Cock-pit of War, moſt gallantly. At the taking of a certain great Town named <hi>Axell,</hi> where within an Engliſh mile of the Town calling ſo many of his Souldiers together as could conveniently hear him, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf to this effect, <hi>That all ſuch of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:116025:110"/>that expoſed their lives to the hazard of Battle, ought to be adviſed of three things. Firſt, the juſtneſs of the cauſe. Secondly, for whom they fight. Thirdly, againſt whom they fight. For the firſt, the juſtneſs of the cauſe, were it onely for the defence of the Goſpel it were ſufficient; but the malice of the Spaniards did moſt evidently appear in their late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for</hi> Ireland; <hi>and ſhould they ſeat themſelves in theſe Nertherland Provinces, they might expect the ſame tyranny for</hi> England. <hi>Then next, the people for whom they drew their Swords, were their Neighbours, alwayes Friends, and Well-will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> to the Engliſh; as contrarily thoſe againſt whom they were to fight, men of another Religion, enemies to God and his Church, a people whoſe unkindeneſs both in nature and life doth ſo excell, that God would not leave them unpuniſhed.</hi> Furthermore he perſwaded them that they were Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>whoſe valour the world both feared and admired; and therefore now they ſhould acquit themſelves like Engliſh-men, for their own credit, and honour of their Countrey.</hi> Which oration wrought in them ſuch reſolutions, that they all vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live and die in that Service. How the Dutch have ſince deſerved their then aſſiſtance of the Queen, or the blood of a <hi>Sidney,</hi> as they have ſince demeaned themſelves, the world may judge. Amongſt other of his ſucceſſes he alſo took in the ſtrong Town of <hi>Dorpe:</hi> But in the full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of his Victories encountering with the Spaniards near to a place called <hi>Zutphen,</hi> when the triumphant Laurells were ready to crown his Brows, he was unfortunately ſhot in the thigh, which is the rendezvouz of nerves and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, which cauſed a Feaver, that proved ſo mortal, that twenty five dayes after he died of the ſame; the night of whoſe death was the noon of his age, and the loſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</p>
               <p>His Body was conveyed into <hi>England,</hi> and moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably interred in the Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> over which was fixed this Epitaph.</p>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116025:111"/>a plentifull eſtate, and ſuch a Son, who as the Vulgar ſpeaks it, could live without the teat; for out of the aſhes of his Fathers infamy he roſe to be a Duke, and as high, as ſubjection could permit, or Sovereignty endure; and though he could not finde out any appellation to aſſure the Crown in his own perſon, yet he projected and very nearly affected it for his Son <hi>Gilbert,</hi> by intermarriage with the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> and ſo by that way to bring it about into his Loins. Obſervations which though they lie behinde us, and ſeem impertinent to the Text, yet are they not extravigant; for they muſt lead, and ſhew us how the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſages were brought about with the dependances, and on the hinges of a collatterall workmanſhip: and truly it may amaze a well ſettled Judgement to look into thoſe times, and to conſider how this Duke could attain to ſuch a pitch of greatneſs. His Father dying in ignomy and at the Gallows, his eſtate confiſcate, and that for pilling and polling, by the clamour and cruſifige of the people; but when we better think upon it, we finde that he was given up but as a Sacrifice to pleaſe the people, not for any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed againſt the perſon of the King; ſo that upon the matter he was a Martyr of the Prerogative, and the King in Honour could do do leſs, then give back to his Son the priviledges of his blood, with the acquirings of his Fathers Profeſſion, for he was a Lawyer and of the Kings Council at Law, before he came to be <hi>ex interioribus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliis,</hi> where beſides the licking of his own fingers, he got the King a maſs of Riches, and that not with the hazard, but the loſs, of his fame and life for the Kings fathers ſake. Certain it is, that his ſon was left rich in purſe &amp; brain, which are good foundations, and fall to ambition; and it may be ſuppoſed, he was on all occaſions well heard of the King, as a perſon of mark and compaſſion in his eye, but I find not that he did put up for advancement, during <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time, although a yaſt aſpirer and provident ſtorer. It ſeems he thought
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:116025:112"/>the Kings Reign was given to the falling ſickneſas; but eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his time fitting, and his Sovereignty in the hands of a Pupill Prince, he thought he might as well then put up for it as the beſt: for having then poſſeſſion of blood, and a purſe, with a head piece of a vaſt extent, he ſoon got ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and no ſooner there, but he began to ſide it with the beſt, even with the Protector; and in concluſion got his, and his Brothers heads; ſtill aſpiring, till he expired in the loſs of his own: ſo that Poſterity may by reading the Father and Grandfather, make Judgement of the Son; for we ſhall finde that this <hi>Robert</hi> (whoſe original we have now traced, the better to preſent him) was inheritour of the genius and craft of his Father, and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of the eſtate, of whom hereafter we ſhall make ſome ſhort mention.</p>
               <p>We take him now as he was admitted into the Court and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> favour; where he was not to ſeek to play his part well, and dexterouſly, but his play was chiefly at the fore-game, not that he was a learner at the latter, but he loved not the after wit: for they report (and not untruly) that he was ſeldome behinde hand with his game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and that they alwayes went away with the loſs.</p>
               <p>To accompliſh his direfull deſigns, it is reported that Doctor <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Allen</hi> were his magical inſtruments; his Phyſicians that waited upon him were admirable poiſoners, that could diſpatch at the time appointed, and not before. At <hi>Cumner</hi> four or five miles from <hi>Oxford,</hi> his firſt Wife fell down a pair of ſtairs and brake her neck, he was alſo ſuſpected for the death of Cardinal <hi>Caſtillian</hi> his great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; after him he ſent the Lord <hi>Sheffield,</hi> as it was thought, by an artificial Catarrhe. <hi>Mounſieur Simers</hi> Ambaſſador to the French King, he forced to fly this Kingdom for his too early prattling to the Queen of this his Marriage with the Lady <hi>Lettice.</hi> He poyſoned Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> with a Saller. The Earl of <hi>Suſſex</hi> that called him the Son of a Traytor, he ſent out of the world with an Italian trick. He
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:116025:112"/>employed his ſervant <hi>Killegray</hi> to ſlay the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> but he fell ſhort of that deſign, as the Poet hath it.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>When <hi>Hanniball</hi> did not prevail by blows,</l>
                  <l>He uſed ſtratagems to kill his ſoes.</l>
               </q>
               <p>His ſervant <hi>Doughty</hi> that knew too much of his ſecrets he ſhipt away, ſo as never to hear of him again. Mr. <hi>Gates</hi> the Pandor of his leachery, for contrived gilt of fellony was hanged; whom he pretended to reprieve on the Gallows, but never ſent any to cut the rope, for he knew he was then paſt telling of tales. Thus he ſerved one <hi>Salvatore</hi> an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, who being more converſant of his privacies then he thought fit, cauſed him to watch with him till midnight, but the next morning he was found dead in his bed in his houſe.</p>
               <p>He was otherwiſe for his out-ſide of a very goodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſingular well featured, and all his youth well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and of a ſweet aſpect, but high foreheaded, which as I ſhould take it, was of no diſcommendation; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his latter end (which with old men was but a middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age) he grew high colloured and red faced: ſo that the Queen in this had much of her Father, for (excepting ſome of her kindred, and ſome few that had handſome wits in crooked bodies) ſhe alwayes took perſonage in the way of her election: for the people hath it this day in Proverb, <hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>loved a man.</hi> He had all advantages of the Queens grace, ſhe called to minde the ſufferings of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, both in her Fathers and Siſters Reigns, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored his and his Brothers blood, creating <hi>Ambroſe</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and himſelf Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> &amp;c, and he was <hi>ex prioribus,</hi> or of her firſt choice; for he reſted not there, but long enjoyed her favour, and there with much what he liſted, till time and emulation (the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of great ones) had reſolved on his period. And to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him at his ſetting in a cloud at <hi>Cornbury,</hi> not by ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a death, as that of his Fathers and Grandfathers
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:116025:113"/>was, but as it is ſuggeſted, by that poyſon, which he had prepared for others. I am not bound to give credit to all vulgar relations, or to the libels of the times, which are commonly forced, and falſified ſuitable to the moods and humors of men in paſſion and diſcontent. His actions were ſo foul that I cannot think him to be an honeſt man, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others of known truth, ſome already mentioned; that of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> death in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Lady doth ſtrongly aſperſe him, queſtionleſs his deeds were good and bad as the times required. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Stateſman as knew how to temporize. He was wonderful popular. To gain himſelf a good opinion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he was free of his promiſes to the Cleargy. Being Chancellour to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to raiſe himſelf a reputation of the Learned, he was the more liberall. And when he had a purpoſe to do a courtefie, he had ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the Queen as to do what he pleaſed, either to beſtow his favours or injuries as he could do, good or wrong to others, but not be wronged himſelf. Thoſe he placed about the Queen he had the wiſdom to keep firme to himſelf. The beſt of the Nobility being either linkt to him by alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of elſe his friends. In <hi>Wales</hi> he had the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> a potent perſon, was his friend in <hi>Ireland.</hi> In <hi>Barwick,</hi> the Lord Archbiſhop <hi>Hunſden.</hi> He had a princely train, another <hi>Mortimer</hi> for gallantry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he was called the heart of the Court. He was a not able diſſembler, without which as <hi>Machiavel</hi> will have it, he could not be rendred ſo grand a Politician. Laſcivious he was at any rate rather then fail, he would <hi>Jupiter</hi>-like deſcend in a golden ſhowre; to which purpoſe he had as gracefull a carriage as if he meant civilly, and onely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Reigns of honour in his hand. There is a Book written of him called his Commonwealth, in which there is more ſaid of him then is true. One of our modern Poets in two lines more truly determines of him.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>My Lord, ſince my laſt Letter unto you, I have litttle new matter worth the writing, ſaving now we are much troubled with the Scottiſh Cauſe; the Commiſſioners of both Parties are now here, and to write unto you that the end will be certainly, as yet I cannot. We finde both Parties very ſtiffe, and hitherto the Kings Party very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute for the maintenance of his Authority; her Majeſties ſcrupuloſity touching his Title and Government; we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the unworthineſſe of their Queen to rule; ſhe granteth but the Inſtances of their Cauſe, to depoſe her from her Dignity ſhe can hardly be perſwaded in: ſo yet ſhe remaineth much perplexed. On the one ſide ſhe is loth to ſet her up, or to reſtore her to her eſtate again. On the other ſide ſhe is loth to defend that which ſhe is not well perſwaded to have juſtice with it; between theſe her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel chiefly ſeek for theſe two things, that her ſelf may be preſerved in ſafety, and the true Religion maintained. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, for as the ſtate of the world ſtandeth, and upon through examination of this Cauſe, it appears that both the wayes be dangerous touching the Queen of Scots; for there is danger in delivering her to Government, ſo is there
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:116025:114"/>danger in retaining her in priſon; her friends begin to ſpeak proudly for her. We were wont alwayes to have a friend on our ſide, if need were; but as far as I can ſee there is none of that ſide of the Sea to be found that be Princes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. Well, our caſe is the harder, and we muſt ſay, <hi>Si Deus nobiſcum, quis contra nos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching this matter, as ſoon as it ſhall grow to any likelihood either of the one ſide, or of the other, I will adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you, and withal ſend you the reaſons of the Advice. In the mean time whatſoever you may hear, believe me there is no man in <hi>England</hi> can tell you which way it will go: Yet in reſpect of the King there, and his continual dealing for the ſaid Queen, her Majeſty rather giveth in words more favourable that way then the other. Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> is arrived here yeſterday, being Shrove-Sunday; after Mr. Secretary was created Baronet <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and I think ere it be long he ſhall have the Office of the Privy Seal, but as yet remaineth Secretary ſtill; and within a day or two Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> is like to be called to aſſiſt him. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to begin the ſecond of April next. The Queens Majeſty thanks be to God is in good health, and all your Friends as you leſt them, ſave Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton,</hi> our good Friend. Your Wiſe was here lately to take her leave of her Majeſty, who uſed her very well and graciouſly. I pray you let us hear as often as you can conveniently. I would gladly underſtand of ſome good for the poor Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Caſtillian.</hi> I deſire and alſo long to hear of the Queens Majeſties Preſent how it is liked. Thus with my hearty Commendations I bid you heartily farewell.</p>

                     <p>I have upon the Receipt of your Letter, written by Sir <hi>E. Gilbert,</hi> dealt with her Majeſty touching your chargeable dwelling there; I truſt her Majeſty will have due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
                     <p>Your ſhall perceive by her Majeſties Letters her further pleaſure touching <hi>Monſieur,</hi> whoſe cauſe hath been broken to her by my Lord of <hi>Buck.</hi> from the Queens Mother. We perceive they deal very daintily, and doubt much her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Intention to Marriage; at leaſt, that ſhe had rather hear of it then perform it. But aſſuredly I do verily believe her Majeſties minde herein is otherwiſe then it hath been, and more reſolutely determined then ever yet at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet do they mean to deal ſo ſecretly on that ſide, as though they will not yet believe it; and accordingly her Majeſty mindeth not to deal but as privately as may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, that if that ſhould not take effect, the leſs reproach to either party. Her Majeſty hath broken this matter with my Lord of <hi>Burleigh</hi> and me, and I think will not uſe any more till ſome appearance fall out what is like to become of the matter. The perſon of <hi>Monſieur</hi> is very well liked of, his converſation is harder to know. I ſee her Majeſty miſliketh not of his eſtate; for ſhe is o minde to marry with the Greteſt, and he is left almoſt above the greateſt to be had; the conditions will be all wherein I am right glad and we are bound to thank God to ſee her Majeſty ſo well to ſtand to the maintenance of the cauſe of Religion; for their will be no great difficulty in reſpect of his perſon and eſtate to cauſe a Marriage between them: So yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with the impeachment any way of the true Religion here now eſtabliſhed, ſhe will for no cauſe deal with him, as you may perceive by her Majeſties own Letters to you,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116025:115"/>albeit ſhe doth not mean in reſpect of his policy to drive him in open ſhew in the mean time to renounce his own profeſſion, but conditionally if they ſhould match, then wholly to maintain this as well privately as publiquely. God ſend her Majeſty alwayes during her life ſo to ſtand to the defence of ſo juſt a cauſe, and withal his bleſſings upon her for us all, that we may live and ſee her bring forth of her own body, as may hereafter ſucceed her as well in that happineſſe, as in the enjoying of her Kingdom. So not doubting but we ſhall ſhortyly hear from you, I commit you to God</p>

                     <p>Sir, I have received your Letters both by Mr. <hi>Wigmore</hi> and <hi>Beal</hi> as by <hi>Harcourt</hi> I did late advertiſe you; and having made her Majeſty partaker both by hearing them read and by her own reading, I am in this ſort directed to anſwer you to the Firſt of the Second, that is, to that of the 13. of <hi>February,</hi> brought by <hi>Beal.</hi> Her Majeſty maketh good account of the perſon of him; I mean the 36 ts 4 tio 30-0 uf I u'c 62 by the Intelligence which he gave you, but it breedeth ſome doubt in her, that the certainty can be no otherwiſe underſtood, in that it is informed you, that the practice continueth by late diſpatching of an Engliſhman of high ſtature and lean of viſage; wherein is ſuch incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as no man can thereby attain either to diſcover the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, or withſtand it by apprehending the party. And ſurely Sir, her majeſty wiſheth you to endeavour your ſelf with ſuch as you ſhall think good to come to the knowledge of ſome perſons, by ſtay of whom ſuch a matter might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered; for my own part, I think it likely that theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices are deviſed, but without more appearance, I ſee no evident reaſon to move me; that in time when the Queen of Scots her ſelf and her factors are in hope to be delivered by treaty, and with the favour of our Queen, there ſhould be any attempt otherwiſe for her eſcape.</p>
                     <p>Wherein how cunning ſoever men be in device, yet the execution ſtandeth upon many adventures, and any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance happening might breed ruine to the whole enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. I have been acquainted with many of theſe like adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, but ſurely I never found any ſubſtance in them in the event; but yet with them and without them I ever finde it good to be circumſpect. I write not to have you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear from hearing and reporting of any the like, but my
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:116025:117"/>experience ſerveth to move you to procure the givers of ſuch things to diſcover the matters more certainly, and ſo they are of more value.</p>
                     <p>The meſſage ſent you from <hi>Rochell</hi> of ſome dangerous intent upon <hi>Ireland</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> hath more appearance, for that we alſo hear it from <hi>Spain</hi> confirmed, and it is the ſame that before I advertſed you concerning <hi>Stukelie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I alſo ſmell ſome purpoſe of the Count <hi>Lodowicks</hi> coming with Ships towards the Low Countries, to accompany the deſign for his brother the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> whereof I would look for ſome better ſucceſs, if I had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof ſo many wayes; for the force of that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe ſhould conſiſt in ſuddenneſs and ſecreſie which are not like to take place. Thus much for your firſt Letter.</p>
                     <p>Now to the ſecond, brought by <hi>Wigmore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Queens Majeſty liketh well of your proceedings with the Spaniſh Ambaſſador there, and marvelleth that he ſhould be ſo coy with you, conſidering the reports of his former courteſies; but by likelihood ſome other accident moved it, which by your next ſpeech will be better diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. The cauſe why that Ambaſſadour could not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſooner of the matter whereof he advertiſed her Majeſty from the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> was, for that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty could not ſooner hear thereof from the Duke If you ſhall finde it convenient to impart matters to the ſaid Ambaſſador, you may let him know of theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, one <hi>Monſieur Senegew</hi> a Low Countreyman, is coming to end the treaty for reſtitution on both ſides of the Merchants goods. There are lately come into the Ports of the Weſt certain Hulks laden from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> driven by tempeſt; and becauſe they ſhould be well uſed, the Ambaſſador here for the King, though in other things he be not uſed, hath been dealt withall to name cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtrangers. Merchants to reſort to the Ports, and they have ſpecial Authority from us to put the ſame in all good
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:116025:118"/>ſafety and that no dealing ſhall be by any to the impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaid goods; and this ſpecial favour is ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time of reſtitution is at hand.</p>
                     <p>And therefore we mean not to give any cauſe of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reling. There were alſo certain other Ships of War that came from <hi>Spain,</hi> being of the company which conducted the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> which being furniſhed with Souldiers, were favourably entertained, and permitted to depart at their pleaſure; of theſe things you may give him knowledge, to make him have a better taſte in his mouth: he may perchance contrariwiſe complain of ſpoil of his Maſters Subjects by pyrats haunting the Narrow Seas, and eſpecially about the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Weight;</hi> and I cannot deny the ſpoils, but ſurely they are committed by one <hi>Lubreſt</hi> and others, belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which we cannot remedy: and yet Mr. <hi>Horſey</hi> is preſently diſpatched with Authority to ſet forth certain Ships, either to take them or drive them from our Coaſt. I confeſs to you privately they are too much favoured <hi>(Lucri Cauſa)</hi> but you may know truly that the Queens Majeſty doth in no wiſe favour them. Thus much to the ſecond Letter.</p>
                     <p>Now to ſome credit given by Mr. <hi>Beal,</hi> concerning) (a few words ſhall ſuffice it. I cannot judge any thing in a 2 3 4 6 8. the matter is much liked, and all furtherers thereof allowed, and all diſſwaders not liked; I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thus to write, that if any mention ſhould be made to you thereof, you ſhould ſhow your ſelf willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe, and ſo you ſhall do well.</p>
                     <p>The retardation uſed herein by H. is not liked by A. and the good will of L. in the furtherance is allowed; by this you may perceive how to order your ſelf; and ſurely this principle I hold, that no one thing ſhall warrant more ſurety and quietneſs to the Queens Majeſty the 3 5 7 in; but the manner and circumſtance are of the ſubſtance of my principals and not accidents: herein I deal boldly with
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:116025:118"/>you, I finde nothing in your writing or doing, but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; if otherwiſe I did, I would advertiſe you for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to your ſelf, and for good will to the Office you bear.</p>
                     <p>Although I cannot advertiſe you certainly as I would of the Grant of your Leaſes, yet I am in the forwardneſs as I truſt by next writing to ſend you knowledge thereof. You muſt hereby be acquainted with the delayes of the Court. From <hi>Greenwich</hi> the third of <hi>May</hi> 1570 Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> I truſt ſhall be admitted to the Councel to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſhortly after to be Secretary. I pray you Sir commend me to Mr. <hi>Cavalcant.</hi>

               <p>I have the rather word for word inſerted the familiar paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of theſe two Letters, that the vigilancy of this great Stateſman might be the more clearly and plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>To proceed; he had not to do with the Sword more then as the great Pay-maſter and Contriver of War, which ſhortly followed; wherein he acompliſhed much tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his theoricall knowledge at home, and intelligence abroad, by unlocking the Counſels of the Queens enemies; he being withall ſo careful a Steward of her Treaſure, that her Exchequer had money or credit when the King of <hi>Spain</hi> wanted both. In that great Faction betwixt <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> he meddled not openly with, though it is eaſie to tell whom he wiſhed beſt too: the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> gave him ſeveral rubs, and he ſome neat State trips; but ſtill in the dark they would not take notice of what one acted againſt another. We muſt now take (and that of truth) into obſervation, that until the tenth year of her Reigh, her times were calm and ſerene, though ſometimes a little overcaſt, as the moſt glorious ſun-riſings are ſubject
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:116025:119"/>to ſhaddowings and droppings; for the clouds of <hi>Spain,</hi> and vapors of the Holy League began then to diſperſe and threaten her Serenity: moreover ſhe was then to provide againſt ſome inteſtine ſtorms, which began to gather in the very heart of her Kingdom; all which had a relation and correſpondency each with other to dethrone her, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the publique tranquility, and therewithal (as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal work) the eſtabliſhed Religion; for the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant began then, and firſt to be known to the world; and till then the Catholiques were no more then Church Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, but were commanded by the Popes expreſſe Letters to appear, and forbear Church-going, as they tender their Holy Father, and the Holy Catholique Church their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that it ſeems the Pope had then his aim to take a true muſter of his Children; but the Queen had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage, for ſhe likewiſe took tale of her Apoſtate Subjects, their ſtrength, and how many they were that had given up their names. He then by the hands of ſome of his Proſelytes fixed his Bulls on the gates of <hi>Pauls,</hi> which diſcharged her Subjects of all fidelity, and laid ſiege to the received Faith, and ſo under the vail of the next Succeſſour, to replant the Catholique Religion; ſo that then the Queen had a new task and work in hand, that might well awake her beſt providence; and required a Muſter of Men and Arms, as well as Courtſhips and Councels: for the times began to be very quick and active, and fitter for ſtronger motions then thoſe of the Carpet. And it will be a true note of her magnanimity, that ſhe loved a Souldier, and had a propenſion in her nature to regard and alwayes to grace them: which the Courtiers taking into obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, took it as an invitation to win Honour, together with her Majeſties favour, by expoſing themſelves to the Wars; eſpecially when the Queens and the Affairs of the Kingdom ſtood in ſome neceſſity of a Souldier. For we have many inſtances of the Sallies of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:116025:119"/>yea, and out of the Court, and her privy Favorites, (that had any touch or tincture of <hi>Mars</hi> in their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) and to ſteal away without licence, and the Queens privity, which had like to have coſt ſome of them dear. So predominant were their thoughts and hopes of honour growing in them, as we may truly obſerve in the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney, Eſſex, Mountjoy,</hi> and divers others, whoſe abſence, and the manner of their eruptions, was very diſtaſteful to her. Whereof I can adde a true and no impertinent ſtory, and that of the laſt, <hi>Mountjoy;</hi> who having twice or thrice ſtoln away into <hi>Brittain,</hi> (where under Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> he had then a Company) without the Queens leave and privity; ſhe ſent a meſſenger unto him, with a ſtrict charge to the General to ſee him ſent home. When he came into the Queens preſence, ſhe fell into a kinde of reviling, demanding how he durſt go over without her leave; Serve me ſo (quoth ſhe) once more, and I will lay you faſt enough for running: you will never leave it, until you are knockt on the head, as that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate fellow <hi>Sidney</hi> was: you ſhall go when I ſend you, in the mean time ſee that you lodge in the Court, (which was then at <hi>White-hall</hi>) where you may follow your Book, read, and diſcourſe of the Wars.</p>
               <p>But to our purpoſe it fell out happily to theſe, and (as I may ſay) to thoſe times, that the Queen during the calm of her Reign was not idle, nor rockt aſleep with ſecurity: for ſhe had been very provident in the reparation and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of her Shipping and Ammunition: and I know not whether by a fore-ſight of Policy, or an inſtinct it came about, or whether it was an act of her Compaſſion; but it is moſt certain, that ſhe ſent Levies, and no ſmall troops to the aſſiſtance of the revolted States of <hi>Holland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had received any affront from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that might deſerve or tend to a Breach in Hoſtility: which the Papiſts this day maintain, was the provocation and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:116025:120"/>cauſe of the after Wars. Which act of hers, though ſome applaud as done in defence of thoſe poor afflicted Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, yet ſhe did not onely therein countenance Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (by conſequence ſince diſable her ſucceſſours) but alſo drew on her ſelf a chargeable and dangerous War with the Spaniard. But omitting what might be ſaid to this point, theſe Netherland Wars were the Queens Seminaries, and the Nurſeries of many brave Souldiers; and ſo were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Civil Wars of <hi>France</hi> (whither ſhe ſent five ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Armies) the Fence Schools that inured the youth and gallantry of the Kingdom; and it was a Militia wherein they were daily in acquaintance with the diſcipline of the Spaniards, who were then turned the Queens inveterate enemies. In the management of which politicial Affairs our <hi>Burleigh</hi> was a great aſſiſtant. The Sword-men of thoſe times complain that he was too much addicted to peace; indeed he would never ingage the State in a War, except ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or her Majeſties Honour required it. To conclude, he was the Column or rather <hi>Atlas</hi> of the State, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſerved his Royal Miſtreſs forty years, dyed at <hi>London</hi> in the ſeventy ſeventh yaar of his age 1598. His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was butied with his Anceſtours in <hi>Stanford-Church.</hi> A monument for his perpetual honour being erected for him in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey, which bears this following inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>

               <p>THis famous Sea Captain Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> one of the firſt that put a Sea Girdle about the world, was born nigh South <hi>Daveſtock</hi> in the County of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his name <hi>Francis</hi> from Sir <hi>Francis Ruſſel</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi>) being his Godfather; he was brought up in <hi>Kent,</hi> his Father was a Miniſter, who for fear of ſix Articles in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth fled into <hi>Kent,</hi> where he lived privately till the death of the King. He got a place to read Prayers amongſt the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Queens Navy, and bound his Son <hi>Francis</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:116025:121"/>to a Shipmaſter, who traded with Commodities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Zealand;</hi> with whom he underwent a hard ſervice, by which means he was trained up to pains and skill at Sea; his Maſter dying, bequeathed him his Bark, with which he a while followed his Maſters profeſſion. But the Narrow Seas being too narrow for his ſpacious ſpirit, he ſold his Bark, venturing himſelf and moſt of his eſtate with Captain <hi>John Hawkins</hi> into the Weſt-indies; but his journey proved unfortunate, for at St. <hi>John de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lva,</hi> his goods were taken by the Spaniards, himſelf hardly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping with life. This loſs ſo exaſperated the ſpirit of <hi>Drake,</hi> that he vowed the Spaniards ſhould repay him with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and to make his word good, after two or three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral voyages into the Weſt-Indies, to gain intelligence, at laſt he effectually ſet forward from <hi>Plimouth</hi> with two ſhips, and ſeventy three men and boyes, ſailing with all ſpeed and ſecreſie to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> the Granary of the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, where the Spaniſh Treaſure lay, intending to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it, being an unwalled Town; but in the aſſault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerouſly wounded, he was forced to retire again to his Ships, when he had well near conquered the Town: thus victory ſometimes ſlips thorow their fingers who have caught it in their hands.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding this diſaſter, enough to have daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a coward from proſecuting his deſign any further, he reſolveth not to give over the project; but whileſt he was determining what to do, a golden opportunity courted him with ſucceſs; certain Negroes called Symerons, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed him of many Mules laden with Gold and Silver which was to be brought from <hi>Panama</hi> over the Mountains. <hi>Drake</hi> who had plowed long Furrows in the Ocean, expecting to have a Golden Harveſt, leaves competent numbers to man his Ships, and with the reſt of his men goes on Land, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepts the prize, being weakly guarded, and carries away an infinite maſs of Gold, hiding the Silver under ground,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:116025:121"/>as not portable over ſo high hills. Then burnt he a great place of Traffique called the Croſs, and in it two hundred thouſand pounds worth of Spaniſh Merchandize; which done, he returned with great Honour and Riches into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This his ſo lucky beginning gave him more hopes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous proceeding; wherefore in <hi>Anno</hi> 1577. he again ſets forth from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> with a Fleet of five Ships, and ſixteen hundred and four men in them, and within twenty five dayes came to <hi>Canline</hi> a Cape in <hi>Barbery;</hi> in his paſſage he took <hi>Nuno-da-Silva</hi> a Spaniſh Pilate, whoſe directions he afterwards much uſed. Hence he took their courſe to the Iſland of <hi>Brava,</hi> being much troubled with tempeſtuous winds, which in one hour vary all the points of the Compaſs; nor was their rain leſs ſtrange poured (not as in other places, as it were out of ſieves, but) as out of ſpots, ſo that a Butt of water falls down in a place: which notwithſtanding was but a frendly in jury, helping them to freſh water, which otherwiſe in that hot Climate far from Land is not ſo eaſily come by. Then cutting the Line, he let every one in his ſhips bloud; there ſaw they that face of Heaven which the Earth hideth from our ſight, but therein onely three ſtars of the firſt magnitude, the reſt few and ſmall compared to our Hemiſphere; as if God (ſaith Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi>) had on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpoſe ſet up the beſt and biggeſt Candles in that room wherein his civilleſt Gueſts are entertained.</p>
               <p>The 16. of <hi>April</hi> he entred the River <hi>Plate,</hi> in which place <hi>John Doughty,</hi> the next to <hi>Drake</hi> in Authority, was queſtioned for raiſing ſedition in the Navy; who being found guilty, was beheaded. Some report <hi>Leiceſter</hi> had given <hi>Drake</hi> in charge to make him away, for words be had ſaid againſt him touching the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> The twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he paſſed the <hi>Magellan Straits</hi> with three ſhips, having caſt off the other two as Impediments; and then entring the Pacifique Sea, his ſhips by tempeſts were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:116025:122"/>from each one, the one whereof was never more ſeen, the other returned home through the Straits. <hi>Drake</hi> himſelf held on his courſe to <hi>Chily, Coquimbo, Cinnano, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Lima,</hi> upon the Weſt of <hi>America,</hi> paſſing the Line the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> till he came to the Latitude 47. intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have come by thoſe North Seas, but unſeaſonable weather made him alter his determination, and bend his Courſe South-Weſt from thence, coming to Anchor 38. degrees from the Line, where the King of that Countrey preſented unto him his Net-work Crown of many colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed feathers, and reſigned therewith his Scepter of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto his Devotion; his people ſo admiring our men, that they ſacrificed unto them, as to their gods. This place for the glory of <hi>England,</hi> he named <hi>Nova Albion,</hi> and at his departure erected a Structure, as a Monument, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs what there had been done. From thence the fourteenth of <hi>November</hi> he fell with <hi>Ternate</hi> one of the Iſles of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucco,</hi> the King whereof entertained him curteouſly, telling them, they and he were all of one Religion in this reſpect, that they believed not in Gods of ſtocks and ſtones, as did the Portugals. Here he took in certain tun of Cloves, with ſome neceſſaries which they wanted.</p>
               <p>But in relating the honour, we muſt not omit the riches he got in this journey, his Prizes being many, and of great value, which by Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> are thus ſummarily deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Looſing from the Iſle <hi>Moucha,</hi> he lighted upon a fellow fiſhing in a little Boat, who ſhewed him where a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſhip laden with Treaſure lay; <hi>Drake</hi> making towards it, the Spaniards thought him to be their own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and thereupon invited him to come on; but he get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aboard, preſently ſhut the Spaniards (being not above eight) under hatches and took the ſhip, in which was four hundred pound weight of Gold. At <hi>Taurapaſa,</hi> going again on ſhore, he found a Spaniard ſleeping by the ſea ſide, who had lying by him twenty bars of maſſy ſilver, to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:116025:122"/>the value of four thouſand Duccats, which he bid his followers take amongſt them, the Spaniard ſtill ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. After this going into the Port of <hi>Africa,</hi> he found there three Veſſels without any Marriners in them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, beſides other wares, were ſeven and fifty ſilver Bricks, each of which weighed twenty pound. Tiding it to <hi>Lime,</hi> he found twelve ſhips in one road, and in them great ſtore of ſilks, and a cheſt full of money coined, but not ſo much as a ſhip-boy abroad, (ſuch ſecurity there was in that Coaſt.) Then putting to ſea with thoſe ſhips, he followed the rich ſhip called <hi>Cacofaga;</hi> and by the way met with a ſmall ſhip, without Ordnance or other Arms, out of which he took fourſcore pound weight of Gold, a golden Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix, and ſome Emralds of a fingers length. And overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Cacofaga,</hi> ſet upon her, and took her; and in her, beſides Jewels, fourſcore pound weight of Gold, thirteen Cheſts of Silver, and (as one writes) as much ſilver as would ballaſt a ſhip.</p>
               <p>And now having fraughted his ſhip with ſo much wealth that a <hi>Miſer</hi> would not deſire any more, he reſolveth to return home; and having a large winde, and a ſmooth ſea, ran aground on a dangerous ſhole, where his ſhip ſtuck twenty hours, having ground too much, and yet too little to land on; and water too much, and yet too little to ſail in. Expecting now no other then death, they betook themſelves to prayer, the beſt lever at ſuch a dead lift; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they received the Communion, dining on Chriſts in the Sacrament, expecting no other then to ſup with him in Heaven. Driven to this ſtrait, they were forced to caſt out of their ſhip ſix great Peeces of Ordnance, threw over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board as much wealth as would break the heart of a <hi>Miſer</hi> to think on, with much ſugar and packs of ſpices, making a caudle of the ſea round about. At laſt it pleaſed God that the winde, formerly their mortal enemy, became their friend, which changing from the Starboard to the Larboard
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:116025:123"/>of the ſhip, and riſing by degrees, cleared them off to the ſea again; for which they returned unfeigned thanks unto Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Having eſcaped this eminent danger, they bent their Courſe South-Weſt, to the Cape of <hi>Bone Speranco,</hi> and by the Weſt of <hi>Africa</hi> returned ſafe into <hi>England,</hi> and landed at <hi>Plimouth November</hi> 3. 1580. The next year he feaſted the Queen in his ſhip at <hi>Dartford,</hi> who knighted him for his ſervice; his Arms were given him, <hi>The World in a Ship.</hi> Which ſhip by the Queens command was drawn on ſhore near <hi>Dartford,</hi> for a Monumant to all poſterity. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this his famous Voyage, a Poet then living directed to him this Epigram.</p>

               <p>In this Voyage ſome Writers not taking notice of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> will needs have Tobacco firſt brought over
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:116025:123"/>into <hi>England;</hi> which though (ſaith one) in ſome reſpect, being moderately taken, may be Phyſicall, yet beſides the conſumption of the purſe, &amp; imparing of our inward parts, the immoderate, vain, and phantaſtical abuſe of the helliſh Weed, corrupteth the natural ſweetneſs of the breath, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifieth the brain; and indeed is ſo prejudicial to the generall eſteem of our Countreymen, that as one ſaith of them, <hi>Anglorum corpora qui huic plantae tontopere indulgent, in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barorum naturam degeneraſſe videntur.</hi> The two chief ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues aſcribed to it, are, that it is good againſt <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> that loathſome diſeaſe, the Pox; and that it voideth Rheum. For the firſt, like enough it is that <hi>ſimiles habent labra lactueas;</hi> ſo unclean a diſeaſe may be fitted with ſo unwholeſome a medicine. For the ſecond good quality attributed unto it, I think it rather to conſiſt in opinion then truth: the Rheum which it voideth, being onely that which it engendreth. But Tobacco it ſelf is by few taken now as medicinal, it is grown a good-fellow, and fallen from a Phyſician to a Complement. For as one of our Modern Poets hath it.</p>

               <p>But to leave this unworthy ſubject, and to return to our Hiſtory, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1588. when all <hi>England</hi> ſtood in fear of a Spaniſh invaſion (though it proved but a Morris Dance upon our Waves) he was made Vice-Admiral of the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; where what he performed towards the waining of that half Moon, the Chronicles report to his eternal honour: his very name being ſo terrible to the Spaniards, that <hi>Don Pedro de Valdes, Vaſques de Silva, Alonzo de Sayas,</hi> and other Noblemen, hearing it was the fiery <hi>Drake</hi> that had them in chaſe, yielded themſelves and came aboard his ſhip; proteſting they were reſolved to dye in defence, had they not fallen under his power; whoſe valour and felicity was ſo great, that <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> ſeemed to wait on his Attempts. Afterwards in the year 1589. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a right to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſued to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for ſuccour againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it from him; ſhe in purſuance of his Title ſent him aid under the command of thoſe renowned Generalls, Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Norris;</hi> who with eleven
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:116025:124"/>thouſand Souldiers, and tweney five hundred Marriners ſet fail from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and arrived at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> a Haven in <hi>Galacia,</hi> took the lower Town by aſſault, and in it great ſtore of ordinance, victualls, cables, ropes, and other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for ſhipping. From thence ſailing towards <hi>Portugal,</hi> in their paſſage they met with <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who without the Queens leave had put forth to Sea, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with his Brother <hi>Walter Devereux,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Butler,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Wingfield,</hi> and others. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two dayes they arrived at <hi>Penycha</hi> a Town in <hi>Portingal,</hi> which they took, leaving the Caſtle to <hi>Don Antonio.</hi> Here left they their ſick and wounded, with ſeven Companies of Foot for their guard. The main Army under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> marched to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> whom <hi>Drake</hi> promiſed to follow with the Fleet; but by reaſon of the Flats which he muſt paſs, and the Caſtle of Saint <hi>Julian</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with fifty peeces of great Ordinance, his purpoſe was diſappointed; yet ſurpriſed he the Town of <hi>Caſcais,</hi> to which place not long after came the whole Army, being neſſitated for want of victualls, and no aid coming in as was expected. Whereupon having taking threeſcore Hulks laden with Corn, and pillaged many Towns and Villages, they returned back again into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This journey producing not that wiſhed effect which was deſired, another more likely was thought upon; Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> well knowing that the Spaniards chiefeſt ſtrength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the Treaſure which he yearly received out of the Weſt Indies, furniſhed Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> with ſhips and ſouldiers to bring this golden Harveſt into the Engliſh Barn. Theſe on the laſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſet ſail from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and ſeven and twenty dayes after, came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coaſt of the great <hi>Canarie;</hi> in aſſaulting of which they waſted much time, to the great grief of Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> who would have preſently ſailed to <hi>America;</hi> and this grief ſay ſome occaſioned his death, though others impute
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:116025:125"/>it to the loſs of his Bark, called the <hi>Francis,</hi> which five Spaniſh ſhips intercepted at the Iſle of Saint <hi>Dominick;</hi> but when the ſame heart hath two deadly wounds given it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is hard to ſay which of them killeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drake</hi> notwithſtanding continued his courſe to <hi>Port-Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Iſland, and caſting anchor within the road, a ſhot from the Caſtle entred the ſteerege of his ſhip, took away the ſtool from under him, wounded Sir <hi>Nicholas Clifford,</hi> and <hi>Brute Brown</hi> to death, as they ſat at ſupper: whereupon the Engliſh enraged, fired five Spaniſh ſhips of two hundred Tuns a piece in revenge of the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>The intention of the Engliſh was to have marcht with their Land Forces from <hi>Port-Rico</hi> to <hi>Panama,</hi> (being an <hi>Iſtmus</hi> which joyneth together <hi>Mexicana</hi> and <hi>Peruana</hi>) where the Spaniſh Treaſure lay. Sir <hi>Thomas Baskervile</hi> with ſeven hundred and fifty men undertook the charge; but the Spaniard having notice of their intentions, had built their Fortreſſes to impeach their paſſage: in aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which firſt, the Engliſh had ſuch welcome that they had no minde to try the ſecond; ſo that fearing their Gold would be dear bought, as well as far fetcht, they returned again unto their ſhips.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drake</hi> afterwards forced <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> and many other petty Towns; but though herein he did the Spaniard much hurt, he did the Engliſh little good: and now thinking with himſelf that according to his preparations, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of his performances would be greater then before; the conſideration thereof accompanied, if not occaſioned the flux, which wrought his ſudden death. <hi>January</hi> 28. 1595. who as he lived by the Sea, died on it, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in it. A man no doubt of admirable parts, and one who had done many worthy ſervices for his Countrey; and yet it is queſtionable whether thoſe rich prizes he brought into <hi>England</hi> did us more good, then Tobacco ſuppoſed firſt brought hither by his followers, hath ſince
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:116025:125"/>done us hurt. One beſtowed this Latine Epitaph upon him.</p>

               <p>SIR <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> the great manager of the Queens pretended match with the <hi>Mounſieur</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> had the honour to be Sir <hi>Philip Sidney's</hi> Father-in-law. He was a Gentleman (at firſt) of a good Houſe, but a better Education; and from the Univerſity travelled for the reſt of his Learning. He was doubtleſs the beſt Linguiſt of thoſe times, but knew beſt how to uſe his own Tongue; whereby he came to be employed in the chiefeſt Affairs of State. He was ſent Ambaſſadour into <hi>France,</hi> and ſtayed there a Leiger long in the heat of the Civil Wars, and at the ſame time that <hi>Mounſieur</hi> was here a Suiter to the Queen; and if I be not miſtaken, he played the very ſame part there, as ſince <hi>Gundamore</hi> did here. At his return, he was taken principal Secretary, and was one of the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:116025:126"/>of State and of the Times, high in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> favour, and a matchful ſervant over the ſafety of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs.</p>
               <p>He is noted to have had certain curious, and ſecret wayes of Intelligence above the reſt: but I muſt confeſs I am to ſeek wherefore he ſuffered <hi>Parry</hi> to be ſo long on the hook before he hoyſed him up; and I have been a little curious in the ſearch thereof, though I have not to do with the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Imperii.</hi> For to know is ſometimes a burthen: and I remember that it was <hi>Ovids, crimen aut error,</hi> that he ſaw too much. But I hope theſe are Collaterals of no danger. But that <hi>Parry</hi> intending to kill the Queen, made the way of his acceſs by betraying of others, and impeaching the Prieſts of his own Correſpondency, and thereby had acceſs and conference with the Queen, and alſo oftentimes fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and private conference with <hi>Walſingham,</hi> will not be the <hi>Quaere</hi> of the Myſtery; for the Secretary might have had ends of diſcovery on a further maturity of Treaſon: but that after the Queen knew <hi>Parry's</hi> intent, why ſhe ſhould then admit him to private diſcourſe, and <hi>Walſingham</hi> to ſuffer it, conſidering the conditions of all aſſailings, and permit him to go where and whither he liſted, and onely on the ſecurity of a dark ſentinel ſet over him, was a piece of reach and hazard beyond my apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>I muſt again profeſs, that having read many of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (for they were commonly ſent to <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> out of <hi>France</hi>) containing many fine paſſages and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; yet if I might have been beholding to his Cyphers, whereof they are full, they would have told pretty tales of the times.</p>
               <p>He was ranked amongſt the <hi>Togati,</hi> chief of thoſe that laid the foundation of the Dutch and French Wars, which was another piece of his fineneſs, and of the times.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:116025:126"/>himſelf and <hi>Stafford</hi> that preceded him, might well have been compared to the Feind in the Goſpel, that ſowed his tares in the night; ſo did they their ſeeds of diviſion in the dark: and it is a likely report that the father on him at his return, that he ſaid unto the Queen with ſome ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Spaniſh deſigns in <hi>France, Madam, I beſeech you be content not to fear; the Spaniard hath a great appetite, and an excellent digeſtion; but I have fitted him with a bone for this twenty years, that your Majeſty ſhall have no cauſe to doubt him; provided that if the fire chance to ſlack which I have kindled, you will be ruled by me, and now and then caſt in ſome Engliſh Fewel, which will revive the flame.</hi>

                     <p>May it pleaſe your Honour to advertiſe her Majeſty, that the King accepted in very good part her congratulation, as from his good Siſter and Neighbour, who hath alwayes wiſhed his well-doing (for theſe were his words.) After congratulation done to the King, the Queen Mother having enquired of me of the well-doing of her Majeſty, asked me how the Queen of Scots did; I anſwered her that at my departure, for any thing I knew to the contrary, ſhe did very well. Then ſhe proceeded to enquire of me, touching her preſent eſtate: I anſwered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of my inſtructions, in what ſtate ſhe ſtood at my departure; wherewith ſhe ſeemed to reſt very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And then ſhe fell to proteſtations, that for her own part ſhe was ſo well perſwaded of the Queens Majeſties merciful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as ſhe knew right well, that if ſhe did deal any thing hardly with the Queen of Scots, it rather proceeded from ſome of her Miniſters, then from her Majeſties ſelf. I replyed that I was glad to underſtand that ſhe conceived ſo well of the Queen my Miſtris's good diſpoſition, ſo was I ſorry that ſhe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:116025:127"/>ſhould think ſhe would be by any of her Miniſters or Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors drawn to any thing, either towards her, or any other, that might not ſtand, with her honour; for that her skill and years was now to direct, and not to be directed. I deſired her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in her Majeſties name that ſhe would evermore reſerve an ear for her: (A thing that would not in equity be denied to the meaneſt perſon in <hi>France</hi>) who in all her actions hitherto to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Queen of Scots, had dealt with that regard to her honour as ſhe was right able to juſtifie her ſelf, both towards the King, her good brother, as alſo towards all other Princes. Then ſhe made great proteſtations of her indifferency, and that ſhe is no leſſe affected in good will towards her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, whom it pleaſeth, ſaith ſhe, to do me the honour as to call me by the name of a Mother, then to the Queen of Scots her daughter-in-law; and therefore in wiſhing her liberty, I do it, ſaith ſhe, as much as for the Queen your Miſtriſs qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs ſake, as for any other reſpect; which without her liberty can hardly grow unto her. This Sir in effect was the whole courſe of the Speech that paſſed from her in that behalf which ſhe had then with me apart. The King being then in talk with my Lord Ambaſſadour, then ſhe cauſed the King to deal with me in that behalf, to whom I ſhewed the ſtate of her cauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the contents of my inſtructions, wherewith he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſatisfied, He told me that he wiſhed that the Queen his good Siſter according to the inclination, would have ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of her cauſe, and grow to ſome ſpeedy concluſion in that behalf.

               <p>SIR <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> a perſon inferiour to none of his predeceſſours, as arch a piece of wit and wiſdom as any of them all. He was a Gentleman, and a man of Law, of great knowledge therein; whereby together with his other parts of Learning and dexterity, he was promoted to be Keeper of the great Seal; and being of kin to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> had alſo the help of his hand to bring him
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:116025:128"/>into the Queens favour; for he was abundantly factious, which took much with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> when it was ſuited with the ſeaſon, as he was well able to judge of his times. He had a very quaint ſaying, and he uſed it often to good purpoſe; that he loved the jeaſt well, but not the loſs of his friend. He would ſay, that though he knew <hi>unuſquiſque ſuae fortunae faber,</hi> was a true and good principle, yet the moſt in number were thoſe that marred themſelves. But I will never forgive that man that loſeth himſelf to be rid of his jeaſt.</p>
               <p>He was Father to that refined Wit, which afterwards act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a diſaſterous part on the publique Stage, and afterwards ſate in his Fathers room as Lord Chancellour.

Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was as able an inſtrument, and it was his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that his head was the mawl (for it was a great one) and therein he kept the wedge that entred the knotty pieces that came to his table.</p>
               <p>He was of the prudent Family of the <hi>Bacons</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk;</hi> he died in the year of our Lord 1578. the threeſcore and ſeventh year of his age, and lieth entombed in the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> with this Latine Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph inſcribed on him.</p>

                  <hi>RObert Devereux</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1566. He had ſcarcely attained to ten years of age, when his Father <hi>Walter Devereux</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> deceaſed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> premoniſhing his Son to have alwayes before his eyes the ſix and thirtieth year of his age, as the utmoſt term of his life, which neither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor his Father before him out-lived; and the ſon did not attain to it. At his Fathers death he was by the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> his Guardian ſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> under the tuition of Doctour <hi>Whitguift,</hi> then Maſter of <hi>Trinity-Hall;</hi> a man of the primitive temper, when the Church by lowlineſs of ſpirit did flouriſh in higheſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Piety and Learning. At ſixteen years of age he took the formality of Maſter of Arts, and kept his publick Acts, yet notwithſtanding his good erudition, it is reported
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:116025:129"/>of him, that like certain Vegetables he did bud and open ſlowly, Nature ſometime delighting to play an after-game as well as Fortune, which had both their tides and turns in his courſe.</p>
               <p>His firſt advancement to Court was by means of the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> yet not ſo much out of love to him, as it was thought, as out of envy to Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> whoſe ſplendour at Court he meant to allay with this young Earl. His firſt appearance in the Fields of <hi>Mars</hi> was at <hi>Tilbury Camp, Anno</hi> 1588. where he was by the Queen made in the Field Commander of the Cavalry, (as he was before in Court) being much graced by her openly in the view of the Souldiery and people, even above my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> himſelf. But ſcarcely was he thus warmed in the Queens favour, when without her conſent or knowledge he thruſt himſelf into the Portugal Voyage, hazarding thereby his future fortunes, beſides the danger of incurring the Queens diſpleaſure, and laying himſelf open to the practice of the Court; notwithſtanding a noble report coming home before him, (as indeed his actions deſerved no leſs) at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all thoſe clouds were diſperſed, and this his excurſion afterwards accounted but a ſally of Youth. Nay, he grew every day taller in her Majeſties grace and favour, inſomuch that the King of <hi>France</hi> imploring her aſſiſtance againſt the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> who in hoſtile manner had invaded his Dominions; the charge of that enterprize was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him; who full of valour, though young in years, being furniſhed with four thouſand Foot and two hundred Horſe, beſides many Pyoners and other Volanteers, whoſe Heroick Aſpects determined the courage of their hearts, landed in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and laid ſiege to the ſtrong City of <hi>Roan;</hi> in aſſaulting whereof his Brother <hi>Walter Devereux</hi> (a Diamond of the time, both of an hardy and delicate mixture) was ſlain with a ſmall ſhot, to the exceſſive grief of the Earl; who after a tedious Winters Siege challenged
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:116025:129"/>
                  <hi>Mounſieur Villerſe</hi> the Governour to a ſingle combate; who not deſirous to purchaſe his honour with the effuſion of his blood, refufed it: with contempt of his refuſal, the Earl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Queen having now experience of his valour, ſoon found an occaſion for him to ſhow it; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> threatning to invade her borders, ſhe thought it the beſt policy to invade his firſt: to perfect ſo great a deſign, a mighty Navy is made ready, conſiſting of an hundred and fifty ſhips, wherein were above 14000. ſouldiers and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Our intended brevity will not permit us to recount the ſeveral Officers in this expedition. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> Lord Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in chief. The firſt of <hi>June</hi> they ſet forth from <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and on the 18. of the ſame moneth came to <hi>Cabo</hi> St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> where they lighted upon an Iriſh Bark, who certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, that at <hi>Cales</hi> from whence they came, were ſtore of Gallies, Ships of War, and Merchant Ships, laden with Munition, Coyn, Oyl, Wine, Wax, Silk, Cloth of Gold, and Quickſilver; news moſt acceeptable unto the Generalls. The twentieth of <hi>June</hi> they caſt Anchor on the Weſt ſide of the Iſland, where a fair Dove, a fortunate preſager of their ſucceſs, lighted upon the main yard of the Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralls ſhip, and ſat there quietly the ſpace of three hours, every man gazing, but no man ſuffered to remove her. The next day a Council being called, it was determined the fight ſhould be begun with the leſſer ſhips, becauſe the road was too ſhallow for the greater; the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Southwell,</hi> with ſome Londoners, and a ſquadron of Low Countrey ſhips undertook the ſame, which they valiantly attempted, manfully maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bravely continued: nor were the Spaniards back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in performance of their duties, but reſolutely fought in defence of their lives; each ſide ſtriving to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:116025:130"/>bravely, which made the fight continue fierce and doubtful.</p>
               <p>The valiant <hi>Eſſex</hi> (though by a Council of War ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to keep the main Battel) upon the ſudden, from <hi>Port Saint Maries</hi> ſide, thruſt himſelf foremoſt in this Sea fight: which the other General perceiving, deſirous to participate of the danger, as well as of the honour of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, forſook his great ſhip, too unweldy for thoſe narrow waters, took into his Pinnace, that he might not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in point of Honour. The ſcales of War which before were even, now turned to the Engliſh ſide: the Spaniſh Admiral a ſhip of fifteen hundred tun, was by their own ſouldiers ſet on fire, whoſe ruine was accompanied with two other ſhips that lay next her; the reſt of their fleet ran themſelves on ground in the Bay of <hi>Port Real.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in purſuit of his deſign landed his men at <hi>Puntal,</hi> a League from <hi>Cales:</hi> to oppoſe his Forces half a mile from the Town appeared many horſe and foot; but they finding the Engliſh numbers exceed their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, they preſently gave back: the Engliſh percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ſtratagem to out-wit them, counterfeiting a fear, made a retreat; by which means having enticed forth their enemies, they returned with ſuch violence that they forced them back into the Town: but there they having an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the higher aſcent, played ſo fore upon the Engliſh, that their foremoſt ranks began to give back; which valiant <hi>Eſſex</hi> perceiving, to engage his ſouldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, caught his own Colours, and caſt them over the Wall into the Town: the undaunted Engliſh aſhamed to loſe their Enſign, forgot all danger, aſcending the wall with ſhot and ſword, make way through the thickeſt preſs of the enemy; in the interim Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> broak the the Gate and ruſhed in, and the reſt with him; divers were wounded with ſtones from the tops of houſes, and Sir <hi>John Wingfield</hi> ſlain in the Market-place with a ſhot from the Caſtle.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:116025:130"/>
               <p>The Town thus ſurprized, the Caſtle was ſummoned, which the next day yielded; the Citizens compounding with the Lords Generalls to pay an hundred and twenty thouſand Duccats for their ranſom, were ſuffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; for the aſſurance of which payment, forty of the chiefeſt Citizens were brought pledges into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Far worſe ſped the ſhips that had run themſelves on ground, who being aſſaulted by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred two millions and a half of Duccats for their redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; but he telling them he was ſent to deſtroy ſhips, not to diſmiſs them upon compoſition, they were by the command of the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonian,</hi> Admirall of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſet altogether on fire: it was judged by the wiſer ſort of people that the Spaniard was damnified by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition no leſs then twenty millions of Duccats. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunacy of this enterprize gave occaſion to one of the Wits then living to frame this excellent Annagram on the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> name.</p>

               <p>The whole Navy returning home ſafe, crowned with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and laden with ſpoils, yet ſeemed the revenge far leſs then the injury offered by the Spaniard: wherefore the next year a third voyage was undertaken, whereof the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was made commander in chief. Their deſign was to intercept the Indian Fleet in their return into <hi>Spain;</hi> many of the Nobility and principal Gentlemen accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Earl in this expedition. The ninth of <hi>July,</hi> 1597.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:116025:131"/>they ſet ſail from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> directing their courſe to <hi>Feral</hi> and the <hi>Groyne:</hi> but God, as a worthy Author interprets, was ſo diſpleaſed at theſe nations enmities, that they had not ſailed forty leagues, but they were encountred with ſuch a terrible tempeſt, that the Marriners themſelves were at their wits end, and the Fleet had much adoe to recover <hi>Plimouth.</hi> And attempting to ſet out the ſecond time, the winde fell ſo croſs, that for a whole moneths time they could not get out of the Haven. The 17 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they again hoiſe ſail, but before they came in view of <hi>Spain</hi> they were diſperſt by another horrible tempeſt; in which they loſt two of their ſhips. The 15 of <hi>September</hi> they fell into the Iſles of <hi>Flores, Evernes, Fyal,</hi> and <hi>Pike,</hi> all which ſubmitted themſelves to the Earls devotion; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they ſailed to <hi>Gratioſa,</hi> whoſe inhabitants ſubmit, and finde mercy: here would the Earl have tarried in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Indian Fleet, had he not been moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily diſſwaded by <hi>Graves</hi> his Pilot; for no ſooner was he gone, but the American Fleet came by, (wherein were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhips, and ſeven of them laden with Treaſure:) theſe fearful ſheep, hearing the Engliſh wolves were abroad, loath to loſe their golden fleece, ſailed with all ſpeed they could to <hi>Tezcera,</hi> where they gained the Haven, all but three ſhips which the Engliſh took; the reſt ſecuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Port, which being impregnable. The Engliſh ſail from thence to Sain <hi>Michaels,</hi> where they took <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> a fair Town well ſtored with Merchandize, wine, wood, and corn; here they tarried ſix dayes, during which ſpace, a Caraque coming out of the Eaſt-Indies, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Engliſh were there, ran her ſelf aſhore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded her Merchandize, and then fired her ſelf. <hi>October</hi> the ninth they hoiſt ſail for <hi>England;</hi> but in their paſſage were aſſailed by ſuch a tempeſt that quite loſt them the ſight of the Spaniſh Fleet, who likewiſe ſuffered much by the ſame tempeſt; for one of their ſhips was caſt upon <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:116025:131"/>the Souldiers and Marriners half ſtarved in her; who upon examination confeſſed, that the Spaniſh Fleets intention was to ſeize upon ſome Haven in <hi>Cornwall:</hi> which being nigh the mouth of the Chancel, might be convenient to receive Forces from <hi>Spain;</hi> but man propoſeth and God diſpoſeth, for the divine providence fruſtrated the deſigns both of the Spaniard and the Engliſh. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> upon his return was created Earl Marſhal of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto have we beheld our Earl aſcending the zenith of Honour, but favourites of great Princes are ſeldom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paraſites; who wanting true worth in themſelves, make a ladder of miſchief to climbe up to promotion: theſe buz into the Earls head ſtrange fancies and chymaera's, that his deſerts were far greater then his rewards; that during his abſence Sir <hi>Robert Cicill</hi> was made Chancellour of the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> created Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> with relation in his pattent to the Victory in eighty eight and his good ſervice at <hi>Cales;</hi> that he was deſcended of the blood royal of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and had better right to the Crown then any other of the compettitors. This puts the Earl upon indirect courſes, and though he cannot attain to be King of <hi>England,</hi> he ſeeks to be made a petty King of <hi>Ireland:</hi> the ſtate of which Countrey (ordained to be the Sepulchre of his Father, and the gulf of his own fortunes) was at that preſent in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous condition, by reaſon <hi>Tir Oen,</hi> a notorious rebell, had lately atchieved ſuch a victory with ſo great loſs to the Engliſh, as they had never felt the like ſince they firſt ſet footing in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whereupon a ſerious conſultation was held on whom to ſend to quell the rebels; <hi>Eſſex</hi> though he ſeemed not to deſire the employment, yet ſtill was ready with his exceptions if any other were nominated: at length it was concluded that he ſhould be the man, and an Army of twenty thouſand foot, and thirteen hundred horſe, alotted unto him; with theſe and a great retinue beſides
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:116025:132"/>of the Nobility, he paſſeth into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His firſt action after his arrival was againſt the Petty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in the Province of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> contrary to his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was to go immediately againſt <hi>Tir Oen</hi> himſelf; but men who prefer their private fancies before publique Inſtructions, ſeldom attain to their wiſhed deſires: For notwithſtanding he took the Caſtle of <hi>Cahir,</hi> and drove the Rebels into the Woods and Groves adjoyning, his Forces by this means were ſo impaired; that the gain did not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the loſs; wherefore ſending for freſh ſupplies out of <hi>England,</hi> in the mean time he ſendeth directions to Sir <hi>Coniers Clifford,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Connaught,</hi> to ſet upon the Rebels in one place, (thereby to ſever their Forces) while he aſſaulted them in another. This counſel though good, yet found ill ſucceſs; <hi>Clifford</hi> with fifteen hundred Souldiers marching towards <hi>Belike,</hi> ſet upon the Rebels; but the Fight continuing long, and the Engliſh wanting Powder, were put to flight, <hi>Clifford</hi> himſelf, and many of the old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being ſlain.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Eſſex</hi> receiveth freſh Forces out of <hi>England;</hi> and withall a check for neglecting the Queens Command; wherefore at length he ſetteth forth towards the borders of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> with thirteen hundred Foot and five hundred Horſe. <hi>Tir Oen</hi> not able to match him in power, yet ſeeketh to over-match him in policy, and by his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger deſireth a parley; <hi>Eſſex</hi> miſtruſting not the poyſon in the bate, condeſcended, appointing the ſhallow of <hi>Balla Clinch</hi> for their meeting place: thither came <hi>Eſſex</hi> alone, with whom <hi>Tir Oen</hi> had private conference a full hour; and not long after by their Delegates concluded a Truce from ſix weeks to ſix weeks till May Day.</p>
               <p>This Tranſaction more incenſed the Queen, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth very ſharp Letters unto him, blaming his delay, and letting ſlip every fair opportunity; with which Letters he likewiſe receiveth advertiſement, that Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:116025:132"/>was made Maſter of the <hi>Wards,</hi> a place which he expected himſelf. This Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> was a man of lame feet, but of a ſound head; one who bare great ſway in the Court, and a ſpecial ſtickler againſt the Earl; which exaſperated him the more, not that he loſt the place himſelf, but that his Adverſary had attained unto it. This State proceeding entred ſo deep into his thoughts, that he ſtudies revenge, and held private conſultations of returning into <hi>England</hi> with part of his Forces, to ſurprize his Adverſaries. But from this dangerous courſe the Earl of <hi>Southamptom</hi> and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Blunt</hi> diſwaded him; yet within a moneth over he went, and came with ſpeed to the Court at <hi>None<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch;</hi> where falling upon his knees before the Queen, after a little talk ſhe bid him retire to his Chamber, and ſoon after committed him to cuſtody in the Lord Privy Seals houſe; where having remained the ſpace of ſix moneths, he began to repent him of his former courſes, and ſhewed ſo great patience, and ſo much ſubmiſſion, that the Queen gave him leave to return to his own Houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Nevertheleſſe the popular voice, the croud of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people ſo extolled his innocency, that ſhe could not, for the removal of ſuſpicion of Injuſtice, free her ſelf and her Councellours, but was forced to bring him to a trial; which accordingly ſhe did in the houſe of the Lord Privy Seal. The chief Articles objected againſt him were, That contrary to his Commiſſion he had made the Earl of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton</hi> General of the Horſe; had drawn his Forces into <hi>Munſter,</hi> neglecting the Arch Rebel <hi>Tir Oen;</hi> entertained a parly with him againſt the Dignity of the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and the perſon of a Vice-Roy, which he repreſented; and that the Parley was ſuſpicious, in regard it was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. The Earl (remembring the words of <hi>Solomon, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> 16.14. <hi>The wrath of a Prince is as meſſengers of death, but a wiſe man will pacifie it,</hi>) fell down upon his knees at the end of the board, profeſſing he would not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:116025:133"/>conteſt with the Queen, nor excuſe the faults of his yong years, either in whole, or in part; proteſting that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes meant well, howſoever it fell out otherwiſe; and that now he would bid his raſh enterprizes adieu: with many other words to the like purpoſe, which made the Aſſembly there preſent to weep. For indeed he was a man dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved both of the Queen, Peers, and People; nor do we read of any Engliſh Subject, whoſe fall was more lamented then his.</p>
               <p>At length this ſentence was pronounced againſt him, That he ſhould be depoſed from the office of a Privy Councellour, ſuſpended from the functions of Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, and Maſter of the Ordnance, and be impriſoned du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Queens pleaſure. And indeed her pleaſure was he ſhould not endure Impriſonment long; for upon his ſhew of humiliation and mortification, ſhe removed <hi>Berkley</hi> his Keeper, and gave him leave to go at large; onely admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to make his own diſcretion his Keeper, and not to come at the Court, or in her preſence.</p>
               <p>Now the Earl thinking all danger was paſt, and that a ſerene sky would ſucceed this ſtorm, in a preſumptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the Queens wonted favour, he became an earneſt ſuiter to her for the Farm of ſweet Wines: ſhe to try the truth of his temper made him this anſwer, That ſhe muſt firſt know what it was worth, and not give away things hand over head. His high ſpirit not brooking a deniall, falls into diſcontented expreſſions which came to the Queens ear. <hi>That it was now plain, the Queen intended to make him as poor as</hi> Job; <hi>that he ſhould live of the basket, and gather crums under the table; that the Queen was now old and decreped, and withered as well in minde as in body.</hi> And now again he runneth upon deſperate counſels, for the removeal of his Adverſaries from the Court. The Earl of <hi>Southam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton</hi> is ſent for out of the Low-Countreys, his doors ſet open for all Commers, decayed Souldiers, and diſcontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:116025:133"/>admitted by <hi>Merrick</hi> his Steward to his own table; Citizens flock thither each day in great numbers, and all ſigns popularity appeared. The chief of his Councel were the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Danvers,</hi> Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge,</hi> Captain of the Garriſon of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Blunt,</hi> his two ſervants, <hi>Merrick</hi> and <hi>Cuffe,</hi> with ſome others: Theſe meeting in conſultation at <hi>Drury Houſe,</hi> reſolve the Queens Palace ſhall be ſeized upon, and his Adverſaries ſecured, who were nominated to be <hi>Raleigh, Cobham, Carew, Cecill,</hi> And the Admiral. But before they could effect their deſigns, the Queen by ſeverall circumſtances having ſuſpicion of their actions, ſent Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Herbert</hi> to call him before the Councel; the Earl doubting the matter, excuſeth himſelf that he was not very well. But this ſlight excuſe encreaſing the ſuſpicion, four of the Lords were by the Queen ſent unto him: namely the Lord Keeper, the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Sir <hi>William Knolles,</hi> and the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England:</hi> theſe comming to <hi>Eſſex Houſe,</hi> found there a confuſed number of people, and the Earls of <hi>Eſſex, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Southampton</hi> in the middeſt of them; after ſome little talk the four Lords were ſecured; <hi>Eſſex</hi> with a Troop of two hundred men at his heels making haſte into City, being falſely informed that the Citizens would take his part. The Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and other Lords meeting him by the way, joyn themſelves, <hi>Eſſex</hi> crying out as he went, <hi>For the Queen, for the Queen, they lay wait for my life.</hi> Whileſt thus he ſeeketh in vain for help of the Citizens, certain of the Nobility en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the City with a Herald, declaring him and all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Traytours: this ſo abated the edge of their courages, that ſome of his followers began to ſhift for themſelves; amongſt which was Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge,</hi> who the better to obtain the Queens mercy, freeth the four Lords that were kept priſoners in <hi>Eſſex</hi> Houſe, going along with them to the Court by water.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:116025:134"/>
               <p>The Earl himſelf thinking to return, was oppoſed by men in Arms at the Weſt end of <hi>Pauls;</hi> where after a ſhort bickering he retired to <hi>Queen-hive,</hi> and went to <hi>Eſſex-Houſe</hi> by water. By and by the Admiral beſiegeth the Houſe, commanding them to yield, which at firſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; but afterwards finding their cauſe to be deſperate, they fall upon their knees, and deliver up their weapons to the Admiral. The chief of them, as <hi>Eſſex, Southampton, Rutland, Sands, Cromwell, Mounteagle, Danvers,</hi> and <hi>Bromley,</hi> were committed to the Tower, the reſt were put in common Priſons.</p>
               <p>The Earl being thus immured, ſent this Letter to Sir <hi>Thomas Egerton</hi> Lord Chancellour. The Copy hereof the better to expreſs the temper of his ſpirit, I have word for word inſerted.</p>

                     <head>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Letter to the Sir. <hi>Thomas Egerton,</hi> Lord Chancellour.</head>
                     <p>My very good Lord, though there is not a man this day living that I ſhould ſooner make judge of any queſtion that might concern me then your ſelf, yet you muſt give me leave to tell you, that in ſome caſes I muſt appeal from all earthly Judges; and if in any then ſurely in this, when the higheſt Judge on earth hath interpoſed upon me the heavieſt puniſhment without tryal or hearing: ſince then I muſt either anſwer your Lordſhips arguments, or elſe forſake mine own juſt defence, I will force mine aking head to do me ſervice for an hour. I muſt firſt deny my diſcontentment which was forced to be an humerous diſcontent; and ſo that it was unſeaſonable, or is ſo long continuing, your Lordſhip ſhould rather condole with me then expoſtulate: natural ſeaſons are expected here below, but violent and unſeaſonable ſtorms come from above. There is no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt to the paſſionate indignation of a Prince, nor yet at
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:116025:134"/>any time ſo unſeaſonable, as when it lighteth on thoſe that might expect an harveſt of their painful and careful labours. He that is once wounded muſt needs feel ſmart till his hurt be cured, or the part hurt before ſenſeleſs: but cure I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect none, her Majeſties heart being obdurate: and be without ſenſe I cannot, being of fleſh and blood. But you may ſay I may aim at the end; I do more then aim, for I ſee an end of all my fortunes: I have ſet an end to all my deſires, in this courſe do I any thing for my enemies: when I was preſent I found them abſolute; and therefore I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould triumph alone, then have me attendant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Chariots. Or do I leave my friends, when I was a Courtier I could tell them no fruit of my love, and now that I am a Hermit they ſhall bear no envy for their love to me: or do I forſake my ſelf becauſe I do not enjoy my ſelf; or do I overthrow my fortune, becauſe I build not a fortune of paper walls; or do I ruinate my honour, becauſe I leave following the purſuit or wearing the falſe ones or ſhadow of honour; do I give courage or comfort to the enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I neglect my ſelf to encounter them; or becauſe I keep my heart from buſineſs, though I cannot keep my fortune from declining: No no, I give every one of thoſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his due right; and the more I weigh them, the more I finde my ſelf juſtified from offending in any one of them. As for the two laſt objections that I forſook my Country when it hath moſt need of me, &amp; fail in that diſſolvable duty which I owe my Sovereign; I anſwer, that if at this time my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey had any need of my publick ſervice, her Majeſty that governeth it would not have driven me to a private life. I am tyed to my Countrey by two Bonds, one pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; to diſcharge carefully and induſtriouſly that truſt which is committed to me; the other private, to ſacrifice for it my life and carkaſs, which hath been nouriſhed in it. Of the firſt I am free, being diſmiſſed by her Majeſty; of the other, nothing can free me but death; and therefore no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:116025:135"/>of performance ſhall ſooner offer it ſelf, but I will meet it half way. The indiſſolvable duty I owe to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, the ſervice of an Earl, and of a Marſhal of <hi>England,</hi> and I have been content to do her the ſervice of a Clerk; but I can never ſerve her as a villain or a ſlave. But you ſay I muſt give way to time; ſo I do, for now I have ſeen the ſtorm come, I have put my ſelf into harbour. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, we muſt give way to Fortune. I know that Fortune is both blinde and ſtrong and therefore I go as far as I can out of the way, You ſay, the remedy is not to ſtrive; I neither ſtrive nor ſeek for remedy. But you ſay, I muſt yield and ſubmit, I can neither yield my ſelf to be guilty, nor this my Impriſonment to be juſt: I owe ſo much to the Authour of Truth, as I can never yield truth to be falſhood, nor falſhood to be truth. Have I given you cauſe you ask, and yet take a ſcandal? No, I gave no cauſe ſo much as to take up <hi>Fimbria</hi> his complaint; I did <hi>tutum telum corpore accipere,</hi> I patiently bear, and ſenſibly feel all that I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived when this ſcandal was given me: nay, when the vileſt of all Indignities are done unto me, doth God require it? Is it impiety not to do it? Why, cannot Princes erre? cannot Subjects receive wrong? Is an earthly power infinite? Pardon me, pardon me my Lord, I can never ſubſcribe to theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: Let <hi>Solomons</hi> fool laugh when he is ſtricken; let thoſe that mean to make their profit of Princes, ſhew to have no ſenſe of Princes injuries. Let them acknowledge an infinite abſolutneſſe on earth, that do not believe an abſolute infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe in heaven. As for me I have received wrong, I feel it; my cauſe is good, I know it: and whatſoever comes, all the powers on earth can never ſhew more ſtrength or conſtancy in oppreſſing, then I can ſhew in ſuffering what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can or ſhall be impoſed on me. I muſt crave your Lordſhips patience to give him that hath a crabbed Fortune leave to uſe a crooked ſtile. But whatſoever it is,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:116025:135"/>there is no heart more ſenſible or more affected towards your Lordſhip, then that of</p>

               <p>The ninteenth of <hi>February</hi> following, <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamdton</hi> were arraigned in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> their Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, for plotting to deprive the Queen of her life and Kingdom, to ſurprize her in her very Palace; and that they brake forth into open rebellion, by impriſoning the Councellors of the kingdom, by exciting the Londoners to rebellion with vain fictions, by aſſaulting the Queens loyal Subjects in the City, and by defending <hi>Eſſex</hi>-houſe againſt the Queens Forces. Hereunto they pleaded not guilty, but being found guilty by there Peers, they had ſentence of death pronounced againſt them by <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, high ſteward of <hi>England</hi> for that time.</p>
               <p>Six dayes after was the fatal day appointed to put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to <hi>Eſſex</hi> his life; the Queen notwithſtanding her <hi>Motto, Semper eadem,</hi> yet in the caſe of life and death was oft times wavering; willing ſhe was to have remitted what was paſt, if ſhe might have been aſcertained of his loyalty for the time to come: nevertheleſs ſhe gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he ſhould not be executed; but being informed he ſhould ſay, He could not live but ſhe muſt periſh, ſhe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded her former word and gave order he ſhould be executed.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of which order he was brought forth to the place of execution, where a Scaffold was erected; ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the Nobility being preſent, where having craved mercy of God, and pardon of the Queen, he had his head ſevered from his body.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth of <hi>March</hi> following, <hi>Merrick</hi> and <hi>Cuffe</hi> were drawn to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and there hanged, and two dayes after, Sir <hi>Charles Danvers,</hi> and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Blunt</hi> were
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:116025:136"/>beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill:</hi> for great men ſeldome fall alone, but as the Poet hath it.</p>

               </q>
               <p>One of our modern writers obſerves that happened to the Counteſs of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> ſhe being fearful in her husbands behalf, gave a Letter which ſhe had received from him to the cuſtody of one <hi>Rihove,</hi> a Dutch woman that waited on her; this Dutchwomans husband, named <hi>Daniel,</hi> lighted by chance upon the Letter, and perceiving ſome paſſages in it, which might bring the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> into danger, got a cunning fellow to draw a counterfeit coppy of the ſaid letter; with this he cometh to the fearful Lady who was newly brought to bed, threatning to give the ſame to her husbands adverſaries, unleſs ſhe would preſently give him three thouſand pounds. She to ſhun the danger, paid him eleven hundred and ſeventy pounds at the very inſtant; yet did he deliver her the counterfeit coppy onely, meaning to make uſe of the true one, to get another ſome of the Earls adverſaries. This impoſter being found out, he was cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perpetual impriſonment, condemned in three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds (two of which were to go to the Counteſs) and his ears nailed to the pillory, with this writing over his head. A notorious Cheater.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude all with ſome few obſervations on this unfortunate Earl: as to his firſt riſe, my Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> introduced him who had married his mother, a tye of affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Sure it is that he no ſooner appeared in the Court, but he took with the Queen and Courtiers; and I believe they all could not chooſe through the ſacrifice of the Father, but look on the living Son; whoſe image by the remembrance of former paſſages was afreſh, like the bleeding of men mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, repreſented to the Court. The <hi>Cicero</hi> of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times parallels him and <hi>Buckingham;</hi> where the difference was is too tranſparent: certain it is, to uſe Sir
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:116025:136"/>
                  <hi>Robert Nauntons</hi> own words, that there was in this young Lord, together with a moſt goodly perſon, a kinde of urba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or innate courteſie, which both won the Queen, and took too much on the people; which amongſt other diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, <hi>Buckingham</hi> never did attain to the latter. What hath been imputed to his fall, is, that he drew too faſt from the Queens indulgence, like a childe ſucking of an over ube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nurſe; which cauſed him to expreſs himſelf in ſuch peremptory language, when he heard that my Lord <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi> received a favour from the Queen for his running ſo well a tilt; when as though he would have limited her reſpects, he ſaid, Now I believe every fool muſt have a favour: which made the Queen ſwear by Gods death, it was fit that one or other ſhould take him down, and teach him better maners. All Authours agree that he was a man of a raſh ſpirit, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty after the uncertain fame of popularity, which helpt him on to his Cataſtrophe.

               <p>THis Earwig of the Court Sir <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> was the Son of the Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> and the Inheritour of his Wiſdom, and by degrees Succeſſour of his places and favours, though not of his Lands; for he had Sir <hi>Thomas Cecil</hi> his elder Brother, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards created Earl of <hi>Exeter.</hi> He was firſt Secretary of State, then Maſter of the Wards, and in the laſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign came to be Lord Treaſurer: all which were the ſteps of his Fathers greatneſſe, and of the Honour he left to his Houſe. For his Perſon he was not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Nature, though ſomewhat for his Face, which was the beſt part of his outſide; but for his inſide, it may be ſaid, and without Soleciſme, that he was his Fathers own Son, and a pregnant Proficent in all Diſcipline of State. He was a Courtier from his Cradle, (which might have made him betimes,) yet at the age of twenty and upwards, he was much ſhort of his after-proof; but expoſed; and by change of climate he ſoon made ſhew what he was, and would be. He lived in thoſe times wherein the Queen had moſt need and uſe of men of weight; and among able ones, this was a chief, as having his ſufficiency from his inſtructions that begat him, the Tutourſhip of the times and Court, which were then the Accademies of Art and Cunning.</p>

The Earl of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> (upon the certainty the Spaniard would invade <hi>Ireland</hi> with a ſtrong Army) had written very earneſtly to the Queen and the Councel for ſuch ſupplies to be ſent over, that might enable him to march up to the Spaniard, if he did land, and follow on his proſecution againſt the Rebels. Sir <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> (beſides the general diſpatch of the Councell, as he often did) wrote this in private; for theſe two began then to love dearly.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:116025:138"/>ability, and his firſt intention, I cannot as yet make any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain judgement; but I believe out of my intelligence, that you may expect there landing in</hi> Munſter; <hi>and the more to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract you, in ſeveral places; as at</hi> Kinſale, Bur-haven, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore, <hi>where you may be ſure (coming from Sea) they will firſt fortifie and learn the ſtrength of the Rebells, before they dare take the field; howſoever (as I know you will not) leſſon not your care, neither your defences; and whatſoever lies within my power to do you and the publick ſervice, reſt thereof aſſured.</hi>

               <p>And to this I would adde much more, but it may (as it is) ſuffice to preſent much as to his abilities in the pen, that he was his Crafts-maſter in forreign intelligence: and for domeſtique affairs, as he was one of thoſe that ſat at the ſterne to the laſt of the Queen, ſo was he none of the leaſt in skill, and in the true uſe of the Compaſs.</p>
               <p>And ſo I ſhall onely vindicate the ſcandal of his death, and conclude him, for he departed in the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> 1612. at Saint <hi>Margrets</hi> near <hi>Marlborough,</hi> in his retun home from the Bathe; as my Lord Viſcount <hi>Cranborne,</hi> my Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> his Son, and Son-in-law, and many more can witneſs. But that the day before he ſwounded in the way, was taken out of the Litter, and laid into his Coach, was a truth; out of which that falſhood concerning the manner of his death had its derivation, though nothing to the purpoſe, or to the prejudice of his worth. He was from his greateſt enemies acknowledged to be a compleat Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a ſupport of the Proteſtant Faction, a diſcloſer of Treaſons, the Mercury of his time. His body lies buried at <hi>Macfield.</hi> He was famous for his buildings, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that called <hi>Brittains</hi> Burſe; with this and other rare edifices to his extraordinary coſt, with which he adorned his Countrey.</p>

               <p>THis Witty (but unfortunate) Knight Sir <hi>Thomas Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was the ſon of Sir <hi>Nicholas Overbury</hi> of <hi>Burton</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> who to his natural propenſion of Ingenuity had the addition of good Education. He having been a while Student of the Law in the <hi>Middle Temple,</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he caſt Anchor at Court, the then Haven of hope for all aſpiring ſpirits. Yet upon ſome diſcontent he deſcended from thoſe lofty Pinacles, and travelled into <hi>France,</hi> where having been ſome time, he returned again, and was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained into the reſpects of Sir <hi>Robert Carre,</hi> one who was newly initiated a Favorite to King <hi>James,</hi> who put him in truſt with his moſt ſecret employments; in which he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf honeſtly and diſcreetly, purchaſing by his wiſe carriage in that place good affection and reſpect, not onely from Sir <hi>Robert Carre,</hi> but of other eminent Perſons. In proceſs of time this favour procured profit, profit indulged honour, honour large employments, and in him expert exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; for where diligence and humility are aſſociate in great affairs, there favour is accompanied with both. So that many Courtiers perceiving great hopes grew into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with him; the Knights expectations are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his buſineſſes accompliſhed beyond his expectation to his wiſhes; ſo that his diligence and parts gained him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:116025:139"/>reſentments from the Viſcount to his uniting him into friendſhip with himſelf; inſomuch; that to the ſhew of all the world this bond was indiſſolvable; neither could there be more friendſhip uſed, ſince there was nothing ſo ſecret, or private, but the Knight imparted it to Maſter <hi>Overbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſome continuance of time, Sir <hi>Robert Carre</hi> is made Viſcount, and Maſter <hi>Overbury</hi> had the honour of Knighthood conferred on him; who grew ſtill more and more into the affections of the people; ſo that now his worth and his wealth were ſo much taken notice of, that he was likely to taper at Court. Theſe Eminencies as they are not unvaluable, ſo in their ſpectatours they raiſe ſcruples and cauſe doubts, eſpecially in the Viſcount; for Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Love can abide no Rivals.</p>
               <p>And indeed what State on earth is ſo firm that is not changeable, or what friendſhip ſo conſtant that is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable? Who would imagine this Viſcount ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſtrumental to his death, who had done him ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice, and to whom he had emboſomed his moſt ſecret thoughts? We ſhall therefore in the next place lay down the grounds of this revolt of friendſhip on the Viſcounts part; for we finde no breach in Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> but that rather his conſtant affection, and free delivery of his opinion (ſcorning to temporize) occaſioned his death.</p>
               <p>There had lately paſt a Divorce betwixt the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the Lady <hi>Frances Howard,</hi> ſo that ſhe being now free, a motion of Marriage was propounded betwixt Viſcount <hi>Carre</hi> and this Lady: Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> who had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a witty Poem, entituled, <hi>The Wife,</hi> thinking her not agreeable to his intentions of Matrimony, diſſwaded the Viſcount from it, with words reflecting much on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes reputation. This counſel, though it proceeded from an unfeigned love in Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> yet where beauty commands, all diſcretion being ſequeſtred, created in the Viſcount
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:116025:139"/>a hatred towards him; and in the Counteſs, the fury of a woman, a deſire of revenge: who perſwaded the Viſcount, <hi>That it was not poſſible that ever ſhe ſhould endure thoſe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or hope for any proſperity ſo long as he lived. That ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred how he could be ſo familiar, ſo much affected to this man</hi> Overbury, <hi>that without him he could do nothing, as it were, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him his right hand, ſeeing he being newly grown into the Kings favor, and depending wholly upon his greatneſs, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be clouded, if not ruined, when his ſervant that knew his ſecrets ſhould come to preferment.</hi> The Viſcount apt enough of his own inclination to revenge, further exaſperated by the Counteſſe, reſolves upon his death; and ſoon he found an occaſion to act it. The Councel finding <hi>Overburies</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſufficiency, nominates him as a fit man to be Ambaſſadour into the Low Countreys to the Arch Duke, as thinking they could not ſerve him up to preferments worthy of his deſerts. Before he had given in his anſwer, the Viſcount comes to him, acting his fatal part againſt Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> diſſwades him from undertaking it; uſing this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>That his preferment and expectations depended not on Forreign Nations. You are now, ſaid he, in credit at home, and have already made triall of the dangers of travel, why then ſhould you hazard all upon uncertainties, being already in poſſeſſion of that you can probably expect by theſe means. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> not doubting the Viſcounts fidelity towards him, was perſwaded by him; forgetting the counſel of the Poet.</p>

               <p>King <hi>James</hi> deeply incenſed with the refuſal of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred honours, for his contempt, commits him to the <hi>Tower;</hi> the <hi>Viſcount</hi> aggravated his offence to the King, but privately promiſed Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> by his intimacy with the King, to bring him off from any troubles that might ariſe: but whatſoever he pretended, he practiſed the contrary. And now having him in the place they deſired, their next ſtudy to ſecure their revenge, was cloſely to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which they concluded to be by poyſon. To this end, they conſult with one Mrs. <hi>Turner,</hi> (the firſt inventor of that horrid Garb of yellow Ruffs and Cuffs, and in which Garb ſhe was after hanged) ſhe having acquaintance with one <hi>James Franklin,</hi> a man skilled for their purpoſe, agreed with him to provide that which ſhould not kill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but cauſe one to languiſh away by degrees, a little and a little. Sir <hi>Jervas Velvis</hi> Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn into the conſpiracy, admits of one <hi>Weſton,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Turners</hi> man, who under pretence of waiting upon Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> was to act that horrid tragedy. The Plot thus contrived, <hi>Franklin</hi> buyes certain poyſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Roſater, White Arſenick, Mercury Sublimate, Cantharides, red Mercury, with three or four more deadly ingredients, which he delivered to <hi>Weſton,</hi> with inſtructions how to uſe them. <hi>Weſton</hi> (an apt ſcloller in the Devils ſchool) tempers them in his broath and meat, increaſing or diminiſhing their ſtrength, according as he ſaw him affected: beſides theſe, poyſoned tarts and jellies are ſent him by the <hi>Viſcount.</hi> At laſt, his ſalt, his ſauce, his meat, his drink, and whatſoever he eats is mingled with poyſon, till his hair fell from his head, and he was ſtrangely forced to part with the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his nails; ſo that had he not been a very ſtrong man he could have never ſtood it out ſo long. Beſides theſe villanies, was added this affliction, that none of his friends were permitted to ſee him, or ſo much as to ſpeak with him but at a window; ſo that all things conſidered, we
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:116025:140"/>may conclude him, as to his outward condition, truly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Viſcount flouriſhes, the marriage is conſumated betwixt him and the Counteſs, and more honours conferred on him, being created Earl of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> hearing of this marriage, makes great lamentation, foreſeeing thereby his own death; yet having ſome weak hopes of the Earl, he ſends this letter to him, to minde him of his former promiſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Right noble and worthy Sir, your former accuſtomed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and abſolute promiſe concerning my preſent deliverance, hath cauſed me at this time to ſollicite your Lordſhip, and to put you in remembrance of the ſame; not doubting that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is at all forgetful of me, but onely (by reaſon of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment) being poſſeſt of divers diſeaſes, would for my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies health and ſafety, taſte the felicity of the open Air; in which cauſe if your Lordſhip pleaſe to commiſerate my preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and procure me my ſpeedy deliverance, I ſhall not onely ſtand ſo much the more obliged to you, but alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you to be the preſerver of my life.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The Earl having received the Letter, returns him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that preſently he could not accompliſh his deſires; but willed him not to doubt, for ſhortly he ſhould have a deliverance: which indeed proved true, thought not as <hi>Overbury</hi> intended; for the conſpirators now hearing ſome inkling of Sir <hi>Thomas's</hi> releaſement, reſolve upon his quick diſpatch; to this end <hi>Weſton</hi> agrees with an Apothecary, for twenty pound, to adminiſter an empoyſoned gliſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> perſwaded that it would be much for his health, takes it; by the infuſion whereof he falls into a languiſhing diſeaſe, with a griping in his guts; the next day after which extremity of pain he died: and becauſe there was ſome bliſters and ugly botches on his body, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators gave it out that he died of the French Pox. This paſt currant, and the miſchief lay concealed a long time,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:116025:141"/>but God who will never ſuffer ſuch miſchiefs to paſs unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, revealed the ſame. <hi>Somerſets</hi> conſcience begins now to accuſe him; that former love that he bore to him, till the eyes of his Lady had enchanted him, returned; his wonted mirth forſakes him, he is caſt down, he takes not that felicity in company he was wont, but ſtill ſomething troubles him. And hearing of the peoples mutterings concerning <hi>Overbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> death, finding the King in a good humour, he makes his addreſs to this effect. <hi>That whereas it had pleaſed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to commit many things unto his charge, and ſome of them proving ſomething too weighty for him to undergo, it was ſo that ignorantly he had run himſelf into a Premunire, whereby he had forfeited to him both his lands, goods, and liberty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it pleaſed him of his wonted favour to grant him pardon for that and many other offences that he had ignorantly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> The King ſtill bearing a good affection towards him, bids him draw his pardon, and he would ſign it. Which accordingly he did, but it comming to the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours hands, he refuſed to let it paſs the Seal, and acquainted the King with the danger that might accrew thereby. And now ſuſpicion growing higher of Sir <hi>Thomas Overburies</hi> death, <hi>Weſton</hi> is examined by the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> who at the firſt ſtiffly denied the ſame; but being perſwaded by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> he tells all: How Miſtreſs <hi>Turner</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs came acquainted, what relation ſhe had to Witches, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, and Conjurers; that <hi>Northampton, Somerſet, Franklin,</hi> the <hi>Monſons,</hi> and <hi>Yelvis</hi> had all their hands in it; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were all apprehended, ſome ſent to the Tower, others to <hi>New-gate.</hi> Having thus confeſſed, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed according to courſe of Law, he was hanged at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn;</hi> after him Miſtreſs <hi>Turner,</hi> after her <hi>Franklin,</hi> then Sir <hi>Jervas Yelvis,</hi> upon their ſeverall Arraignments of the fact, were found guilty, and executed; ſome of them died very penitent and ſorrowful for what they had done againſt ſuch an incomparable perſon. The Earl and his Counteſs
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:116025:141"/>were both condemned, but through the Kings gracious pardon had their lives ſaved, but were never admitted to the favour of the Court.</p>
               <p>This Ingenuous Knight, whoſe death was ſo generally lamented, was the other <hi>Sidney</hi> of this Nation. One of our Modern Writers obſerves, that he was too honeſt, which with the Machiavelians is interpreted to be too open breaſted; as they retain this principle, that one that waits on great perſons ought to keep a ſecret till his breath ſtinks. Whereas without queſtion he did enlarge himſelf too much alſo in his diſcourſe to others, which beſides his down-right Integrity to the Viſcount, being as ſharp Wits are too much addicted to an unfortunate way of jeering and jeaſting, muſt of neceſſity prove fatal to him; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of a woman being alwayes in purſuit. His Poem of a Wife is to the life; his Characters to this day not outwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any. To give a taſte of the reſpects thoſe times ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him, I have affixed theſe following Verſes.</p>

               <head>The Life of Sir VVALTER RALEIGH.</head>
               <p>SIR <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> the Learned <hi>Apollo</hi> and Oracle of our Nation was one that (it ſeems) Fortune had pickt
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:116025:143"/>out of purpoſe, to make an example of her mutability or tennis-ball, thereby to ſhew what ſhe could do; for ſhe toſt him up of nothing, and too and fro to greatneſs, and from thence down to little more then to that wherein ſhe found him; (a mean Gentleman) not that he was leſs, for he was well deſcended, and of good Alliance, but poor in his beginnings. And for my Lord of <hi>Oxfords</hi> Jeaſt of him (the Jack, and an upſtart) we all know, it ſavours more of emulation and his humour, then of truth; and it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain note of the times, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her choice never took into her favour a meer new man, or a Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, as <hi>Comines</hi> obſerves of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> who did ſerve himſelf with perſons of unknown parents; ſuch as was <hi>Oliver</hi> the Barber, whom he created Earl of <hi>Dunoyes,</hi> and made him <hi>ex ſecretis conſiliis,</hi> and alone in his favour and familiarity.</p>
               <p>His approaches to the Univerſity and Inns of Court, were the grounds of his improvement; but they were rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, then ſieges or ſettings down, for he ſtayed not long in a place; and being the youngeſt brother, and the houſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed in patrimony, he foreſaw his own deſtiny that he was firſt to rowl (thorow want and diſability to ſubſiſt other wayes) before he could come to a repoſe: and as the ſtone doth by long lying, gather moſs, he firſt expoſed himſelf to the Land Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Militia which then did not yield him food and rayment, (for it was ever very poor) nor had he patience to ſtay there, though ſhortly after he came thither again under the command of the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> but with his own colours flying in the field; having in the interim caſt a new chance, both in the Low Countries, and in a voyage to Sea. And if ever man drew vertue out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, it was he: therewith was he the great example of induſtery; and though he might then have taken that of the merchant to himſelf, <hi>per mare, per terras, currit mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator ad Indos,</hi> he might alſo have ſaid, and truly with the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:116025:144"/>Philoſopher, <hi>Omnia mea mecum porto;</hi> for it was a long time before he could brag of more then he carried at his back; and when he got on the winning ſide, it was his commedations that he took the pains for it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went many various adventures for his after perfection. And before he came into the publique note of the world, and that it may appear how he came up <hi>(per ardua) per varios caſus, per tot diſcrimina rerum,</hi> not pulled up by chance, or by any gentle admittance of Fortune: I will briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his native parts, and thoſe of his own acquiring which was the hopes of his riſing.</p>
               <p>He had in the outward man a good preſence, in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and well compacted perſon, a ſtrong natural wit, and a better judgement, with a bold and plauſible tongue, whereby he could ſet out his parts to the beſt advantage; and to theſe he had the adjuncts of ſome general learning, which by diligence he enforced to a great augmentation, and perfection; for he was an undefatigable reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Sea or Land; and none of the leaſt obſervers, both of men and the times. And I am confident, that among the ſecond cauſes of his growth, that variance between him and the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> in his deſcent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> was a principall; for it drew them both before the Councel Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there to plead for themſelves; where (what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he had in the cauſe, I know not) but he had much the better in the telling of his tale; and ſo much that the Queen and the Lords entertained no ordinary conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his perſon, and his parts: for from thence he came to be known, and to have acceſs to the Queen, and to the Lords; and then we are not to doubt how ſuch a man might riſe by his compliance, the moſt expeditious way of progreſſion. Whether <hi>Leiceſter</hi> had then caſt in a good word for him to the Queen I cannot determine; but true it is, he had gotten Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> ear at a trice, and ſhe began to be taken with his elocution, and loved to hear
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:116025:144"/>his reaſons to her demands; and the truth is, ſhe took him for a kinde of Oracle, which nettled them all: yea, thoſe that he relyed on, began to take his ſudden favour for an allarum, and to be ſenſible of their own ſupplantation, and to project his, which made him ſhortly after ſing, <hi>Fortune my foe,</hi> &amp;c. So that finding his favour declining, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a receſs, he undertook a new peregrination to leave that <hi>Terra infirma</hi> of the Court, for that of the Wars; and by declining himſelf, and by abſence, to expell his, and the paſſion of his enemies, which in Court was a ſtrange device of recovery; but that he knew there was ſome ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice done him, that he durſt not attempt to minde any other wayes, then by going aſide: thereby to teach envy a new way of forgetfulneſs, and not ſo much as to think of him. Howſoever, he had it alwayes in minde never to forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and his device took ſo well, that at his return he came in (as Romans do, by going backwards) with the greater ſtrength, and ſo continued to her laſt, great in her grace, and Captain of the Guard. One obſervation more may not be omitted; namely, that though he gained much at the Court, yet he took it not out of the Exchequer, or meerly out of the Queens Purſe, but by his Wit, and the help of the Prerogative; for the Queen was never profuſe in the delivering out of her Treaſure, but payed many, and moſt of her ſervants part in money, and the reſt with grace, which as the caſe ſtood, was taken for good payment, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the arrear of recompence due to their merit, to her great ſucceſſour, who payed them all with advantage; our <hi>Rawleigh</hi> excepted, who fortunately in the very firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign, fell into his diſpleaſure, by combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Lords, <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Griffin Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, George Brook</hi> Eſquire and ſeveral others, to deſtroy the King, raiſe ſedition, commit ſlaughter, move rebellion, alter Religion, ſubvert the State, to procure Invaſion, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy War, and to ſet up the Lady <hi>Arabella Steward,</hi> &amp;c. of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:116025:145"/>all which crimes being arraigned, he was found guilty, and condemned. But King <hi>James</hi> being a Prince of peace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſtain the beginning of his Reign with blood, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with onely his Impriſonment, this following Letter to his Favorite having ſaved his life.</p>

                     <p>If I preſume too much, I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, eſpecially in preſuming to write to ſo great and ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Perſon, who hath been told that I have done him wrong. I heard it but of late, but moſt happy had I been if I might have diſproved that villany againſt me, when there had been no ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that the deſire to ſave my life had preſented my excuſe. But my worthy Lord, it is not to excuſe my ſelf that I now write: I cannot, for I have now offended my Sovereign Lord, for all paſt, even all the World, and my very Enemies have lamented my loſs; whom now if his Majeſties mercy alone do not lament, I am loſt. Howſoever that which doth comfort up my ſoul in this offence, is, that even in the offence it ſelf I had no other intent then his Majeſties ſervice; and to make his Majeſty know that my late enterprize was grounded upon a truth; and which with one ſhip ſpeedily ſet out, I meant to have aſpired, or have died; being reſolved, as it is well known, to have done it from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> had I not been reſtrained. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I hoped not onely to recover his Majeſties gracious Opinion, but to have deſtroyed all thoſe Malignant Reports that had been raiſed of me. That this is true, that Gentleman whom I ſo much truſted, my Keeper, and to whom I opened my heart, cannot but teſtifie; and wherein I cannot be believed living, my death ſhall witneſs: yea, that Gentleman cannot but avow it, that when we came back to <hi>London,</hi> I deſired no other treaſure then an exact deſcription of thoſe places in the <hi>Indies.</hi> That I meant to go hence as a diſcontented man; God I truſt, and my own actions will diſſwade his Majeſty, whom neither the loſs of my Eſtate, thirteen years Impriſonment, and the denial of my
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:116025:145"/>pardon could beat from his ſervice, or the opinion of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a fool, or rather a diſtract, by returning as I did, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced with my love to his Majeſties perſon and eſtate, had no other place in my heart.</p>
                     <p>It was the laſt ſevere Letter from my Lords for the ſpeedy bringing of me up, and the impatience of diſhonour that firſt put me in fear of my life, or enjoying it in a perpetual Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, never to recover my Reputation loſt, which ſtrengthened me in my late and too late lamented reſolution. If his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Mercy doth not abound, if his Majeſty do not pitty my old age, and ſcorn to take the extreameſt and utmoſt advantage of my errours; if his Majeſty in his great charity do not make a difference betwixt offences proceeding from a life, ſaving natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall impulſion, without all ill intent, and thoſe of an ill heart; and that your Lordſhip, remarkable in the world for the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your diſpoſition, do not vouchſafe to become my ſucceſſour; whereby your Lordſhip ſhall binde a hundred Gentlemen of my Kindred to honour your Memory, and bind me for all that time my life, which your Lordſhip ſhall beg for me, to pray to God that you may ever proſper; and ever binde me to remain</p>

               <p>He remained priſoner in the Tower above thirteen years, during which time he writ that Elabourate Work, entituled, the Hiſtory of the World; which Book for its worthineſs Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> termeth, <hi>Primus in Hiſtoria.</hi> When at laſt being deſirous of his liberty, he ſtudied his <hi>exit,</hi> acquainting the King with the avaritious Intelligence of a rich Mine which himſelf and one Captain <hi>Kemiſh</hi> had formerly diſcovered by the Informations of the Indians in the Countrey of <hi>Guia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> For the obtaining of which, if his Majeſty would pleaſe to give him leave to make a journey thither, he made no doubt but to benefit the State, without prejudice to the Spaniard. Which Propoſition was condeſcended unto by
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:116025:146"/>the King, as he then imagines he would be far enough from his Complices; but he commanded to ſet down not onely the Countrey, but the very River by which he was to enter it: as alſo to name his ſhips, number, men, and Artillery. Which being known to <hi>Gundamore,</hi> Leiger Ambaſſadour here for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he writes to his Maſter with the purpoſe of his Voyage. Upon which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> directed his Letters to all parts of the Indies to provide for his comming. Nevertheleſs Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> proſecuted his deſign, and having endured infinite dangers, beſides a tedious journey, at laſt he came to <hi>Guyana,</hi> where he was much cheriſhed of the Indians of his acquaintance. But falling deſperately ſick, he gives order to five ſmall ſhips to ſail into <hi>Drinoque,</hi> having Captain <hi>Kemiſh</hi> for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour towards the Mines. But paſſing up the River by Saint <hi>Thame,</hi> they were ſet upon by the Spaniard; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they aſſaulted the Town, and took it. But in the charge Maſter <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>Walters</hi> ſon (more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of honour then ſafety) was ſlain. The Engliſh find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſtout oppoſition, that there was no way for them to obtain their purpoſe but onely by deſperate deſigns, the Spaniards having ſo fortified the paſſage to the Mines, they were forced to return, to the great grief of Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh;</hi> who told <hi>Kemiſh</hi> upon his return that he had undone him, and wounded his credit with the King paſt all recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which cauſed <hi>Kemiſh</hi> deſperately to kill himſelf. And now Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> being returned into <hi>England, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damore</hi> ſo exclaimed againſt him to the King for breach of Peace, and ſo wrought upon his timerous diſpoſition, that he was committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi> Where expecting every hour to be ſacrificed to the Spaniſh cruelty, ſome few dayes before he ſuffered, he ſent for Maſter <hi>Walter Burre,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly printed his firſt Volumn of the Hiſtory of the World, whom taking by the hand, after ſome other diſcourſe, he askt him how that Work of his had ſold. Mr. <hi>Burre</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:116025:146"/>this anſwer, that it had ſold ſo ſlowly, that it had undone him. At which words of his, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> ſtepping to his Desk, reaches his other part of his Hiſtory to Mr. <hi>Burre,</hi> which he had brought down to the times he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in; clapping his hand on his breaſt, he took the other unprinted part of his Works into his hand, with a ſigh, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ah my Frend hath the firſt part undone thee, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume ſhall undo no more; this ungrateful world is unworthy of it. When immediately going to the fire ſide, he threw it in, and ſet his foot on it till it was conſumed: As great a loſs to Learning as Chriſtendome could have, or owned; for his firſt Volumn after his death ſold thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</p>
               <p>And now the time approached wherein he was to act his laſt part on the Stage of this world, he firſt ſent this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter to King <hi>James.</hi>

                     <p>It is one part of the office of a juſt and worthy Prince to hear the complaints of his Vaſſals, eſpecially ſuch as are in great miſery. I know not amongſt many other preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions gathered againſt me, how your Majeſty hath been perſwaded that I was one of them who were greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and therefore the more likely to prove diſloyal: But the great God ſo relieve me in both worlds as I was the contrary; and I took as great comfort to behold your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, &amp; alwayes learning ſome good, and bettering my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by hearing your Majeſties diſcourſe. I do moſt humbly beſeech your ſovereign Majeſty not to believe any of thoſe in my particular, who under pretence of offences to Kings, do eaſily work their particular revenge. I truſt no man, under the color of making examples, ſhould perſwade your Majeſty to leave the word merciful out of your ſtile: for it will be no leſs profit to your Majeſty, and become your greatneſs,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:116025:147"/>then the word invincible. It is true that the Laws of the Realm are as no leſſe jealous of the Kings, then <hi>Caeſar</hi> was of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Wife; for notwithſtanding ſhe was cleared for keeping company with <hi>Claudius,</hi> yet for being ſuſpected, he condemned her. For my ſelf, I proteſt it before God Almighty, and I ſpeak it to my Maſter and Sovereign, that I never invented Treaſon againſt him: and yet I know I ſhall fall <hi>in manibus corum à quibus non poſſum evàdere,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by your Majeſties gracious compaſſion I be ſuſtained. Our Law therefore, moſt merciful Prince, knowing her own cruelty, and knowing that ſhe is wont to compound Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of her own preſumptions and circumſtances, and doth give this charitable advice to the King her ſupream, <hi>Non ſolum ſapiens eſſe, ſed miſericors, &amp;c. cum tutius eſt reddere rationem miſericordiae quam judicii.</hi> I do therefore on the knees of my heart beſeech your Majeſty from your own ſweet and conformable diſpoſition, to remember that I have ſerved your Majeſty twenty years, for which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath yet given me no Reward; and it is fitter I ſhould be indebted to my Sovereign Lord, then the King to his poor Vaſſal. Save me therefore, moſt merciful Prince, that I may owe your Majeſty my life it ſelf, then which there cannot be a greater debt. Limit me at leaſt my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, that I may pay it for your ſervice when your Majeſty ſhall pleaſe. If the Law deſtroy me, your Majeſty ſhall put me out of your power; and I ſhall have none to fear but the King of kings.</p>

                     <hi>My Honourable Lords, and the reſt of my good Friends that are come to ſee me die, know that I much rejoyce that it hath pleaſed God to bring me from darkneſs to light, and in freeing me from the</hi> Tower, <hi>wherein I might have died in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, by letting me live to come to this place; where though I loſe my life, yet I ſhall clear ſome falſe accuſations unjuſtly laid to my charge, and leave behinde me a teſtimony of a true heart both to my King and Countrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Two things there are which have exceedingly poſſeſt and provoked his Majeſties indignation againſt me,</hi> viz. <hi>A confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy or combination with</hi> France, <hi>and diſloyal and diſobedient words of my Prince. For the firſt, his Majeſty had ſome cauſe, though grounded upon a weak foundation to ſuſpect mine inclination to the French Faction; for not long before my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:116025:148"/>from</hi> England, <hi>the French Agent took occaſion, paſſing by my houſe to viſit me; we had ſome conference during the time of his abode onely concerning my Voyage, and nothing elſe, I take God to witneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another ſuſpicion is had of me, becauſe I did labour to make an eſcape from</hi> Plimouth <hi>to</hi> France: <hi>I cannot deny, but that willingly, when I heard a rumour, that there was no hope of my life upon my return to</hi> London, <hi>I would have eſcaped for the ſafeguard of my life, and not for any ill intent or conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The like reaſon of ſuſpicion aroſe, in that I perſwaded Sir</hi> Lewis Stenkly, <hi>my Guardian, to flee with me from</hi> London <hi>to</hi> France; <hi>but my anſwer to this is, as to the other, that onely for my ſafeguard, and nought elſe, was my intent, as I ſhall anſwer before the Almighty,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is alledged, that I feigned my ſelf ſick, and by art made my body full of bliſters when I was at</hi> Salisbury. <hi>True it is, I did ſo, the reaſon was, becauſe I hop'd thereby to defer my coming before the King and Councel, and ſo by delaying might have gained time to have got my pardon. I have an example out of Scripture for my warrant, that in caſe of neceſſity, and for the ſafeguard of my life;</hi> David <hi>feigned himſelf fooliſh and mad, yet it was not imputed to him for ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning the ſecond imputation laid to my charge, that I ſhould ſpeak ſcandalous and reproachful words of my Prince, there is no witneſs againſt me but onely one, and he a Chymical Frenchman, whom I entertained rather for his Jeaſts then Judgement. This man to incroach himſelf into the favor of the Lords, and gaping after ſome great reward, hath falſely accuſed me of ſeditious ſpeeches againſt his Majeſty; againſt whom if I did either ſpeak or think a thought hurtful or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, Lord blot me out of the Book of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is not a time to flatter or fear Princes, for I am a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to none but deatb; therefore have a charitable conceit of me: that I know to ſwear, is an offence, to ſwear falſely at any
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:116025:148"/>time is a great ſin; but to ſwear falſely before the preſence of Almighty God, before whom I am forthwith to appear, were an offence unpardonable: therefore think me not now raſhly, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly to confirm, or proteſt any thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for other Objections, in that I was brought perforce into</hi> England, <hi>that I carried ſixteen thouſand pounds in Money out of</hi> England <hi>with me more then I made known; that I ſhould receive Letters from the French King, and ſuch like; with many proteſtations he utterly denied.</hi>

               <p>Having ended his Speech, he ſaluted the Company; and after he had made his addreſſes to heaven, ſubmitted his neck to the ſtroak of the Axe.

               <head>The Life of Mr. <hi>William Cambden.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis learned Antiquary, who ſo diligently preſerved the memories of many noble Families of this Nation, and whoſe laborious Works have been a great light to Hiſtories already extent, and ſuch as future Ages ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, is deſervedly placed amongſt our Heroes; that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:116025:149"/>he whoſe pen made ſo many others live, in his never dying <hi>Brittania,</hi> may likewiſe live here in this preſent Work, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of our Engliſh Worthies.</p>
               <p>He was Son to Maſter <hi>Sampſon Cambden,</hi> deſcended of an ancient family in <hi>Staffordſhire;</hi> his Mother was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the worſhipful family of the <hi>Curwens</hi> in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> as he himſelf witneſſeth in his <hi>Britannia.</hi> He was born in the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> in the City of <hi>London, Anno.</hi> 1550. That he was well educated, his learned Works make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; being put to School, firſt in <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> then at <hi>Pauls.</hi> At fifteen years of age, (ſo ſoon was he ripened for the Univerſity) he went to <hi>Magdalen Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford:</hi> where having much profited, he removed from thence to <hi>Broadgates Hall,</hi> where he gave ſome proofs of his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe ſhort Latin graces the Servitors ſtill uſe. From thence he went to <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> where he attained to ſuch eminency, as his abilities preferred him to be Maſter of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is as a learned Gentleman obſerves, ſcarce any profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Common-wealth more neceſſary, which is ſo ſlightly performed.</hi> The reaſons whereof he takes to be theſe. <hi>Firſt, young Schollars make this calling their refuge; yea perchance before they have taken any degree in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, commence Schoolmaſters in the Countrey; as if nothing elſe were required to ſet up this profeſſion, but onely a Rod and a Ferula. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, others who are able uſe it onely as a paſſage to better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, to patch the rents in their preſent fortune, till they can provide a new one, and betake themſelves to ſome more gainful calling. Thirdly, they are diſheartned from doing their beſt, with the miſerable reward which in ſome places they receive; being Maſters to the Children, and ſlaves to their Parents. Laſtly, being grown rich, they grow negligent, and ſcorn to touch the School, but by the proxie of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Schoolmaſter was of another temper, ſtudying his Schollars natures, as carefully as they their Books, and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:116025:149"/>rankt their diſpoſitions into ſeveral forms; for that School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter deſerves to be beaten himſelf, who beats nature in a Boy for a fault. The truth is, our Engliſh Schoolmaſters, I mean the unworthier ſort of them, to conceal their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and continue their profits, keep Boyes in <hi>Lillies</hi> Grammar; firſt to get it by ſhort leſſons, by heart, and then to conſtrue it, which they have a Book to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with; continuing ſo long in this no leſs ſlothful and knaviſh practice of theirs, that Foot-boyes and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks in other Countries ſpeak good familiar Latine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are out of our <hi>Quae Genus:</hi> it being a cuſtom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas to chuſe a large Grammar, as <hi>Diſputerius,</hi> or the like, which they onely explain, and then fall to their Vocubularies, familiar Authors, and Dictionaries; and in a ſhort time are able to travel with the Latine Tongue over the world. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> taking great pains in the eruditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of youth, continued ſo for a long ſpace, till that he was called aſide: Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> making him firſt Richmond Herald, and not long after Clarenceaux King of Arms; ſo that here was the ſtory, as Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> writes of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> inverted, who from a King became a Schoolmaſter, but here a Schoolmaſter became a King; (I mean of Arms) which place he diſcharged with great integrity, being very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to preſerve the memories of extinguiſh'd families, and reſtoring many to their own rightful Arms; as alſo to curb their uſurpation who unjuſtly entitle themſelves to ancient families. Spending his time under a peaceable Prince, he had leaſure to compoſe thoſe moſt excellent Works of his, which he left behinde him, as a Monument of his never dying fame. <hi>Viz.</hi> his <hi>Britannia,</hi> which he wrote in Latine, ſince tranſlated into Engliſh by <hi>Philemon Holland</hi> Doctor of Phyſick. A Book which will ſpeak its own worth better then my rude Pen can ſet it forth. His Hiſtory of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Original and true Edition of which he writ in Latin, it was Printed at <hi>London</hi> in Folio. The
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:116025:150"/>leſſer Volumes Printed in <hi>Holland</hi> are corrupted. That paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in favour of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots left out, for which the doors of the Cloiſters being ſhut too by one with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to diſguiſe, he was ſoundly banged about the walks with theſe words often repeated, <hi>For Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo was diſmiſſed, not knowing to his dying-day, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſo much pains upon him. He wrote a Greek Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, which for the clear method and brevity of it, is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by no forreign nation. His laſt book which one would have had written on his monument for his Epitaph, <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens Remains,</hi> contains the Languages, Names, Sirnames, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, Annagrams, Armories, Monies, Empreſſes, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Artillery, wiſe Speeches, Proverbs, Poſies, and Epitaphs.</p>
               <p>To recreate the Reader, I think it not amiſs to relate ſome few paſſages out of this laſt mentioned book, that it may appear, that our moſt graveſt Authors would many times mix ſomewhat of mirth with their more ſolid writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, to draw the Reader on as well by pleaſure as profit.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other pleaſant paſſages he mentions, <hi>Johannes Erigena,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Scotus,</hi> a man renowned for learning, who ſitting at the Table, in reſpect of his learning, with <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, Emperour and King of <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf as a ſlovenly Schollar, nothing courtly: whereupon the Emperour asked him merrily; <hi>Quid inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt inter Scotum &amp; Sotum;</hi> What is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Scot and a Sot? He merrily, but yet malapertly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Menſa,</hi> the Table; as though the Emperour were the Sot and he the Scot.</p>
               <p>In another place he mentions the Emperour did ſet down unto him a diſh with two fair great fiſhes, and one little one; willing him to be carver unto two other Schollars that ſat beneath him: this Maſter <hi>John,</hi> who was but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle man, laid the two great Fiſhes upon his own Trencher, and ſet down the other little Fiſh unto the two Schollars, who were big men; which when the Emperour ſaw, he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:116025:150"/>ſmiling ſaid, <hi>In faith, Maſter</hi> John, <hi>you are no indifferent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider? yes, if it like your Highneſs, very indifferent</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for here</hi> (pointing to himſelf and the two great Fiſhes) <hi>be two great ones, and a little one, and ſo yonder</hi> (reaching his hand towards the Schollars) <hi>are two big ones and a little one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He continues with the pleaſant relation of <hi>Winefridus</hi> born at <hi>Kirton</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> after ſirnamed <hi>Boniface,</hi> who converted <hi>Freeſland</hi> to Chriſtianity, was wont to ſay, <hi>In old time they were golden Prelates, and wooden Chalices, but in his time wooden Prelates, and golden Chalices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then diſcourſes in another place of <hi>Ethelwold</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> in a great famine, ſold away all the ſacred Gold and Silver Veſſels of his Church, to relieve the hunger-ſtarved poor people, ſaying, <hi>That there was no reaſon that the ſenſeleſs temples of God ſhould abound in riches, and living Temples of the Holy Ghoſt ſtarve for hunger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another place, that when <hi>Hinguar</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> came ſo ſuddenly upon <hi>Edmund</hi> King of the Eaſt-Angles, that he was forced to ſeek his ſafety by flight; he happened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily on a troop of Danes, who fell to examining of him, whether he knew where the King of the Eaſt-Angles was; whom <hi>Edmund</hi> thus anſwered, <hi>Even now when I was in the palace, he was there, and when I went from thence, he departed thence, and whether he ſhall eſcape your hands or no, God knoweth.</hi> But ſo ſoon as once they heard him name God, the godleſs infidels pittifully martyred him.</p>
               <p>In another place he takes notice of a quick retort to <hi>Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fery,</hi> baſe Son to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second; who being by him advanced to the See of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> would in his Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Oaths alwayes proteſt, <hi>By my faith, and the King my Father.</hi> But <hi>Walter Mapes,</hi> the Kings Chaplaine told him, <hi>You might do as well to remember ſometimes your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honeſty, as to mention ſo often your Fathers Royalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As alſo of <hi>Eubulus</hi> a ſcoffing Comical Greek Poet, who
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:116025:151"/>curſed himſelf, if ever he opened his mouth againſt women; inferring, albeit <hi>Medea</hi> were wicked, yet <hi>Penelope</hi> was peerleſs; if <hi>Clytemneſtra</hi> were naught, yet <hi>Alceſtes</hi> was paſſing good; if <hi>Phaedra</hi> were damnable, yet there was another laudable: But here, ſaith he, I am at a ſtand; of good women I finde not one more, but of the wicked I remember thouſands.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe I have read in an old Manuſcript, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are all in extrems, too willing, or too wilful; too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or too froward; too friendly, or too fiendly; too courteous, or too coy; the mean they alwayes meanly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of.</p>
               <p>As alſo of a certain Captain, who being perſwaded to marry, replied no; If I marry a Wife, ſhe will be wilfull; if witty, then wanton; if poor, then peeviſh; if beautiful, then proud; if deformed, then loathſome; and the leaſt of theſe is able to kill a thouſand men.</p>
               <p>But I fear I have been too prolix, I ſhall onely adde one ſtory concerning Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> then give you a taſte amongſt many others of ſome of his merry Epitaphs, and ſo proceed. There was a noble man merrily conceited, and riotouſly given, that having lately ſold the Mannour of an hundred Tenements, came ruffling into the Court in a new Suit, ſaying; <hi>Am not I a mighty man that bear a hundred houſes on my back?</hi> Which Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> hearing, ſaid, <hi>You might have better employed it in paying your debts. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my Lord</hi> (quoth be) <hi>you ſay well, for my Lord, my father, owed my maſter, your father, three half pence for a Calves-head; hold, here is two pence for it; Wolſey's</hi> Father being a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. I will onely ſet down a few lines of his merry Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs as reſemblances of the reſt.</p>

Maſter <hi>Thomas Sutton</hi> was of a good extract born in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> the then ſeat of Baron <hi>Willoby</hi> of <hi>Eresby,</hi> where in his youth he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and liberally brought up; he had ſome knowledge of the Languages, and might paſs for more then an indifferent Schollar. In his youth he attended <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and afterwards preſented his ſervice to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> with whom for ſome ſpace of time he was in high favour, as alſo with his Brother, that Fox of the State, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> In proceſs of time the eminency of his Qualifications being more particularly taken notice of, he was preferred, made Maſter of the Ordnance of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> of the Laws of which Caſtle I have ſeen a tranſcript reputed to have been under his own hand. This place he held for a long time quietly, the <hi>Barwick</hi> Ordinance having been ſince charged to Covenant purpoſes; but by him onely ſhot off with ſilver for Charitable uſes. The truth is, he firſt raiſed his eſtate from that employment, by living ſparingly and thrivingly, continually purchaſing and improving of what he had got by merchandize and otherwiſe. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in his latter time he withdrew himſelf from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of converſation, and dwelt in a little Town called <hi>Caſtle-Camp</hi> in the County of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> there he lived privately many years, retained no great Family, entertained few Gueſts, obſcured himſelf as much as he could, and made no ſhow of his Eſtate; yet notwithſtanding his wealth was
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:116025:153"/>ſo every where openly known, that at laſt every one gave him the name of the Rich <hi>Sutton.</hi> And now by this time it was the general wonder of all men, he having no Heir, how he would diſpoſe of his great eſtate: This made his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, with emulation one to another in his ſickneſs, moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to attend him; and in his health, againſt the time of his ſicknes they ſtrove who ſhould preſent him with the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gifts; every one of them being freely accepted of. The old man, who as he received all, ſo they thought at his death to have their own again with the largeſt Intereſt.</p>
               <p>I have converſed with ſome of the Wits, who credibly informed me, that <hi>Ben. Jonſons</hi> Play of the Fox under the name of <hi>Vulpone,</hi> had ſome alluſion to Mr. <hi>Suttons</hi> maner of treating of his Kindred. But to paſs by ſuch impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as he had vaſte ſums, ſo he had vaſte thoughts; he had honourable wayes, and determined uſes to empty his bags with: the word <hi>P. F.</hi> being not heard of in thoſe dayes. A Friend of his, with whom he was very intimate, walking with him in his Summer-Parlour, thought to pleaſe him with a motion of putting out a ſumme of his money to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt on good ſecurity. Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> ſhewing a diſlike, told him, that he had other purpoſes, and for the lawfulneſs of Uſury he was not ſo fully convinced of it, but that he did believe that the moſt confident Uſurer that ever lived would give the beſt bag he had on his death-bed to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that caſe of conſcience. He being asked by his friend what he would then do with his money, he anſwered, that he was onely as treaſurer and diſpoſer for poor and wanting perſons: which words of his agreed with his mind, as the end of his Life declared. For as he determined with himſelf, ſo he afterwards built an Hoſpital, having firſt got a Grant from K. <hi>James</hi> confirmed by Act of Parliament. To this purpoſe, having bargained with <hi>Tho.</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> for a Houſe then called the Seat of the Carthuſians, now the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi> which was much out of repair; this with many thouſands of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:116025:153"/>pounds he bought of the Earl, though ſome aſperſe him, and report that he got it into his hands firſt by fraud, the Deeds being intruſted to him, that he kept them; by which ſubtilty he had the advantage to make his own market. I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, but if it were true, he had great need, if it could ſtand him in any ſtead, to fly to that Scripture which the Romaniſts make ſo much uſe of, <hi>Charity covers a maltitude of ſins.</hi> But to paſſe by this diverſion, this Houſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe he bought lawfully of the Earl, which he turned into an Hoſpital: When he was very old, and conſidering how ſoon his crazineſſe and weakneſſe might ſet a period to his life, and not knowing what injuries the preſent or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages might act againſt his Charity, he took ſuch care to confirm his will by the Royal power, and the Laws of the Land, that except it hath been abuſed by the corruption of ſome particular covetous perſons, it hath not been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe violated. The particulars of his Teſtament are too large to be inſerted here, I refer the Reader to the printed Copy: I ſhall onely out of it inſtance a few particulars. He beſtowed upon his Kindred, Friends, and Servants, vaſte ſummes of money, beſides ſix thouſand pounds a year to the Hoſpital: For the performance whereof he choſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, wiſe, and experienced Executours. His Will being thus perfected, he fell deadly ſick at his Houſe at <hi>Hackney</hi> near <hi>London;</hi> in the year of our Lord 1611. he died. Not long after his death the Houſe began to be turned into an Hoſpital, though after his deceaſe, this good work with ſeveral quirks and pretences of Law was opoſed, as to the very foundation of it, the Kings ears being abuſed. At laſt ſuch was the faithful zeal of thoſe that were intruſted, God aſſiſting them in ſo honourable actions, that the Inſtitution came to perfection by a quiet poſſeſſion to the uſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a Library, as a gift worthy of ſuch an Hoſpital. In this Houſe fourſcore old men are maintained, which ſhould be decayed Gentlemen and Souldiers, according to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:116025:154"/>the Doners intent, who are to have an allowance both for their bodies and ſouls. There is alſo a School for thirty children of poor parents; though I am credibly informed rich perſons of late years, that make the greateſt friends, ſooneſt get their children in; an abuſe of the Will of the deceaſed, and a crying oppreſſion of the poor. Theſe Children have their conſtant diet and clothing. There are ſeveral other ſtipends for the Governour, Overſeers, Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, nad Chyrurgeons of the Hoſpital, together with an annual allowance, and an ample ſtipend aſſigned to a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſter, who in the Chappel on the Lords Day is to preach to the Hoſpitallers with prayers twice every day in the week. An honourable gift to the end of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the diſtreſſed members of our Saviours body.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> was firſt buried in <hi>Chriſts-Church</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but afterwards removed and interred in the Chappel of his Hoſpital the <hi>Charter-Houſe,</hi> where a coſtly Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was erected for him by his Executours. The Papiſts that glory ſo much of their good works, cannot ſhew a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler foundation for a particular perſon of his quality.</p>
               <p>To conclude, though our actions of Charity are never ſo great, (fooliſhly thought by them meritorious) yet if not the effects of a true ſaving faith, they are loſt, and a man may for all his Charity go to the Devil. And though the Catholiques would plead from the form of the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Matthew</hi> 25. that God accepts men to Life for their deeds of Charity, feeding, clothing, relieving, &amp;c. yet the Scripture fully teſtifies, that God neither accepts theſe, nor our ſelves for them, no further then they are the effects of a true faith; our perſons being firſt juſtified by faith in Chriſt, then God will crown our works. This according to the holy Writ we acknowledge, that Charity for the perpetuity of it excells all other Graces; when we have poſſeſſion of thoſe pleaſures that we believed and hoped, what longer uſe is there of faith and hope: but our Love
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:116025:154"/>ſhall not end with our lives; we ſhall everlaſtingly love our Maker, Saviour, Sanctifier, Angels, and Saints: where no diſcontent ſhall breed any jar in our Halelujahs. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, as the uſe of Mr. <hi>Suttons</hi> Love and Charity was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and delight to him on earth, what can we think it will be to him in heaven?</p>

               <head>The Life of the moſt Noble, Sir FRANCIS BACON Viſcount of Saint ALBANES.</head>
               <p>AFter I had beſtowed much pains, and ſtrictly enquired the tranſactions of the life of this incomparable Knight, having finiſht it with all the ingenuity, care, and impartiality of a ſtudious minde, I at laſt had the happineſs to meet with it in Latine, exactly and admirably done by Doctour <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> his Chaplain; who as he diſcharged his faithful truſt in publiſhing of ſome of his Works, I thought my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do him the right of the alone ſetting forth of his Life more eſpecially, as no perſon better knew him then this Reverend Doctour; I have onely tranſlated what he did word for word, neither adding nor detracting.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> the Honour of his age and Countrey, the credit and ornament of Learning, was born at <hi>York-Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> a noted Street, adjoyning to the City of <hi>London,</hi> on the 22. day of <hi>January,</hi> in the year of mans ſalvation, MDLX. His Father was that famous Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and while he liv'd, one of the chief Props and Pillars of her Kingdom, Sir <hi>Nicholas Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> Knight, Keeper of the great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> a Heroe of approved wiſdom, judgement, moderation, and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:116025:155"/>His Mother was <hi>Anne,</hi> a Daughter of Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> (who had the education of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth King of <hi>England</hi>) a Lady both of ſingular Piety and Vertue, and eminently learned, having no mean skill, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering her Sex, in the Greek and Latine Tongues; ſprung from ſuch Parents, what manner of perſon he was like to prove; is hence eaſie to conjecture, ſince no advantages ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Nature or Education could be imagin'd to be wanting to him: he paſt the more tender years of his childhood not without rare teſtimonies of many growing excellencies, and great abilities of mind; nor did he come on faſter in age, then in ingenuity and acuteneſs of wit, which promiſed high aſſurances of that profound and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal knowledge and comprehenſion of things which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him afterwards ſo famous, and brought him to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by many noble perſons, and others that were eminent both in dignity and place; and principally by the Queen her ſelf, who, as I have heard from ſome of repute and credit, took much delight oftentimes to diſcourſe with him, and to try his wit with difficult queſtions; but with ſo much gravity and deliberate judgement did he behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the Queen was us'd to call him the little Lord Keeper of the Seal. Being askt of her how old he was, he yet a childe, ingeniouſly anſwered, That he was the yonger by two years for her happy Reign. When he had attained the age that was thought ripe for the Univerſity, or rather more early then others commonly us'd to go, he was by his Fathers appointment entered of <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> under the tuition of the moſt Reverend <hi>John Whitgift</hi> Doctour of Divinity, at that time Maſter of that Colledge, afterwards Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> a Prelate of the firſt magnitude, and moſt conſpicuous for Sanctity, Learning, Patience, and Humility, under whom he was found to have made a wonderful progreſs in the Liberall Arts and Sciences, and above all that were his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:116025:155"/>while he gave himſelf up wholly to his ſtudy in the Univerſity, wanting yet ſomewhat of ſixteen years of age. The Philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (as his Lordſhip hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to impart to me in private diſcourſe) began to ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury and diſtaſteful to him, not out of any diſeſteem of that Author, for it was ever his cuſtom to load him with high praiſes; but becauſe of the inſufficiency of that way of Philoſphy, ſince it was ſo contriv'd and diſpos'd (as his Lordſhip was oftentimes pleas'd to inculcate) as if it had been fram'd onely for diſputations and controverſies, and was altogether barren as to the production of ſuch operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as tended to the benefit of humane life; in which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he perſiſted to his very laſt gaſp.</p>
               <p>After he had run through the whole courſe of the Liberal Arts, his Father thought fit to have him bend and apply himſelf chiefly to the ſtudy of Politicks; and for that cauſe, took care to ſend him into <hi>France,</hi> in the Company of Sir <hi>Amie Pawlet,</hi> at that time appointed Ambaſſadour in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to the French King. He had not been there very long, ere he was ſo far lookt upon, as to be thought a fit perſon to be ſent into <hi>England</hi> upon ſome ſpecial meſſage to the Queen; which employment having worthily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd, he was ſent back by the Queen, not without ſome teſtimony of her grace and favour. Upon his going into <hi>France</hi> the ſecond time, he took this reſolution, not to ſee <hi>England</hi> again, till after ſome certain-years expired. During his travels in <hi>France,</hi> his Father the Lord Keeper died; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving behinde him (as I have heard from ſome that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his affairs) a conſiderable ſum of money, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſet apart for the purchaſing of certain Lands and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, for the uſe of this his youngeſt Son; who onely of all the reſt was left after his Fathers deceaſe, deſtitute of a hereditary patrimony: for though in his Fathers eſtate, yet not in his Fathers affection; held he the loweſt place But ſince the buying of thoſe Lands was onely intended and not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:116025:156"/>performed in his Fathers life-time, there fell no more to his ſhare, then according to the proportion of money that was to be diſtributed among five brothers; which was the cauſe that he enjoy'd but a ſlender and ſomewhat hard fortune during his yonger years; for he came not to the poſſeſſion of that noble and moſt delightful Mannor of <hi>Gorhambury</hi> till many years after, and that by the death of his moſt dear Brother Mr. <hi>Anthony Bacon,</hi> a man of great note, and one that had been much converſant in the Courts of Forreign Princes; for the excellency of his Wit equal, but for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Liberal Arts, inferiour to his Brother. Between theſe two there had ever paſt a moſt firm league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as being, beſides the ſame paternal extraction, united by a more ſtrict tye of having both one Mother.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he return'd out of <hi>France,</hi> his care was to pitch upon ſome certain courſe of life; thereupon he addicted himſelf to the ſtudy and profeſſion of the common Law of <hi>England:</hi> in which undertaking he in a ſhort time made an admirable progreſs. Although to uſe his own words he made choice of that profeſſion, rather as ſubſervient and auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, then as his principal intention. He ſet forth from the firſt to the laſt divers Tractates concerning this ſubject; in which, though perhaps by ſome of the ancient ſtanders of that profeſſion, he might be exceeded as to the bulk of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume and number of caſes; yet for matter of weight, and his inſight into the fundamentals and myſteries of the Law, he gave place to none. He had ſcarce ſerv'd out his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip in the Law, before he was by the Queen taken into her learned Council extraordinary; a favour, as I have heard, ſcarce granted to any one before. The habitation he choſe as moſt commodious for his ſtudies and Office of Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, was amongſt the honourable ſociety of <hi>Grey's-Inne,</hi> into the number of which Society he admitted himſelf; there he erected that neat and elegant ſtructure, which at this day is known by the name of the Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:116025:156"/>in which at times he ſpent the greateſt part of his life (ſome few years onely excepted) even to the very day of his death. In this Society he carried himſelf with that mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that affability and generoſity of minde, that thereby he attracted to himſelf great love and reſpect from the Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and Students of that Inne.</p>
               <p>But though he was tied by the exigence of his fortune, and for his better maintenance to profeſs the Law; yet his minde and affection inclin'd more to the Political Arts and Offices of State: of which if it had pleaſed her Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, he was as capable as any. In the full ſtrength of his age he admitted himſelf of the number of thoſe that followed that noble, though unfortunate Heroe, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> whom as a moſt faithful and boſom Councellour, he ſerved to his utmoſt power, ad ſtill laboured to inſtill into his minde wholeſom and honourable precepts; till at length that Earl giving ear to the counſels of certain raſh and hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd men, ran head-long to his own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>This he ow'd to the native and ingenuous endowments of his minde, that they opened to him an eaſier and freer acceſs unto the Princes Court, then to any others of the ſame profeſſion; and ſo by conſequence to the preſence of the Queen her ſelf, who did not think much to enter into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him apart: and with much familiarity (as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as there was offered any opportunity) not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Profeſſion, and about matters of Law; but alſo about the weighty affairs of State, and the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the kingdom: and at all times he gave her ſuch judicious anſwers, that ſhe received great ſatisfaction by them. But though ſhe abundantly cheriſht him with the favour of her countenance, yet never with the favour of a bountiful hand; as never having advanc't him to any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick office, either of honor or profit, excepting onely one dry reverſion of a <hi>Regiſters Office in the Star-Chamber,</hi> computed at the yearly value of 1600. pound; into the poſſeſſion of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:116025:157"/>which he came not till about twenty years after, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about: of which office his Lordſhip ſaid pleaſantly in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, <hi>That it was like another mans Farm border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his own houſe, and ſo might help his proſpect, but not fill his Barn.</hi> But in King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, he at length en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd that office, and manag'd it by a deputy. Now that he was not ſooner preferr'd cannot be any way attributed to the leaſt averſion or diſpleaſure that the Queen had in her minde againſt him, but to the fraud and envy of ſome one of the Noble men, (at that time powerful with the Queen) who ſought by all means poſſible to depreſs and hinder him; leſt if he ſhould be advanced to any heighth of honour, his own glory ſhould be eclipſed by him. However though in the time of his Miſtris Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> his merited promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſtill foreſtalled or kept back; yet after the change of Government and the coming in of his new maſter King <hi>James,</hi> he with a quickned pace ſoon made a large progreſs; being by this King eminently enobled with places of truſt, honour, anſt great revenues. I have ſeen ſome letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own hand to King <hi>James,</hi> in which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth him to have been ſo good a maſter to him, as to have nine times conferred upon him his iterated favours, thrice titles of great honour, ſix times offices of profit: the Offices he means, I ſuppoſe were theſe; he being <hi>Councel extraordinary to his Majeſty,</hi> in which place he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerved the Queen, <hi>the Kings Sollitour General, the Kings Atturney General, or principal Procurator, made one of the Kings Privy Council,</hi> while yet he held the place of Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General, <hi>Lord Keeper of the great Seal of England, laſtly Lord Chancellour of England.</hi> Which two laſt Offices, although they are the ſame in Authority and Power; yet in their Patent, degree of honour, and favour of the Prince, they differ: and ſince the time of his holding that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, none of his ſucceſſours hath been honoured with that title unto this day. His honours were firſt his being Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:116025:157"/>by the King, then he was created Baron <hi>Verulam,</hi> laſtly Viſcount of St. <hi>Albons;</hi> beſides other rich gifts and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a bountiful hand, which his Majeſty was pleaſed to beſtow upon him, as well out of the profits of the great Seal, as out of the Office of Alienation.</p>
               <p>When he had arrived to that part of his age, in which fortune ſmiled upon him, he began to think of marrying; and at length took to Wife <hi>Alice</hi> the Daughter and one of the Heirs of <hi>Bennet Bernham</hi> Eſquire, and Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> with whom he received a very conſiderable Dowry, as well in Land as in ready money: children he had none by her; but for as much as children conduce very much to the perpetuating our names after death, he was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtitute of that advantage, ſince it was his hap to be bleſt with an other kinde of Off-ſpring, for the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his memory to after times: namely, the Off ſpring of his brain, in which he was alwayes wonderfully happy, like <hi>Jove</hi> himſelf, when he was delivered of <hi>Pallace.</hi> Nor did this want of children in the leaſt meaſure abate his affection to his Wife, toward whom he behav'd himſelf as an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Husband, and ſhewed her all manner of conjugal love and reſpect, beſtowing upon her rich Furniture, precious Jewels, and likewiſe ſettled upon her a fair Joynture: nor is it to be omitted in honourable remembrance of him, that ſhe wore a rich Wedding Gown which he had beſtowed upon her, about twenty years after his death; for ſo long ſhe ſurviv'd her moſt honoured Husband.</p>
               <p>The laſt five years of his life, retiring himſelf from Court-Affairs, and all kinde of buſie employments, he bent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to ſtudy and contemplation; which kinde of life ſeem'd indeed to be moſt pleaſing to him, as if he would have choſen by his good will to dwell rather in the ſhade then in the ſun-ſhine. Of which alſo we may find ſome not obſcure intimations in the reading of his Works; in which ſpace of time he wrote the greateſt part of his Books, as well thoſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:116025:158"/>that were written in Engliſh as in Latin; which according to the order of time that they were written in, I (who was preſent all the while and obſerv'd) ſhall endeavour to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on up, and they were theſe following. <hi>The Hiſtory of the Reign of</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh, King of</hi> England; written in Engliſh. <hi>The Abecedary of Nature, a Metaphyſical</hi> tractate, which, I know not by what evil fate, periſht. <hi>The Hiſtory of the Windes.

Between ſome of theſe came that learned work of his, call'd <hi>The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning;</hi> in the Tranſlating of which (a thing undertaken of his own accord) out of his native Tongue into the Latine, our moſt honour'd Author took very great pains, and from time to time inricht it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and various additions. After theſe came his <hi>Councels, Civil and Moral,</hi> formerly call'd Eſſays, augmented both as to their number and weight, <hi>in the Engliſh tongue. Some of</hi> Davids <hi>Pſalms Compoſed into Engliſh Verſe.</hi> Moreover di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Works already mention'd, he converted out of Engliſh into Latin, which were theſe. <hi>The Hiſtory of the Reign of</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh, King of</hi> England. <hi>His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels Civil and Moral,</hi> call'd <hi>Faithful ſayings, or the Inward ſenſe of things. The Diologue of the Holy War, and the Fable of New Atlantis;</hi> theſe he tranſlated in favour of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, by whom he heard they were deſired. Other Books that he writ originally in Latin were, <hi>his book of the Wiſdom of the Ancients,</hi> review'd by himſelf. The laſt place was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by his <hi>Syvla Sylvarum, or Natural Hiſtory;</hi> a work
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:116025:158"/>written in Engliſh. And theſe were the fruits which ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſhade of the fore-mentioned five years. The Books compoſed before that five years ſpace I here paſs by; but it was fully determin'd by him at the command of the late moſt Serene King <hi>Charles,</hi> to have compil'd the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth King of <hi>England:</hi> but that Work proceeded not beyond deſignation onely, it pleaſing God to put a period to the life of this moſt famous Authour. Yet there is extant a certain taſte of that Hiſtory which a few morning hours of one day brought forth, publiſht in Engliſh amongſt his Miſcellany Works; and from thence you may diſcern the Lion by his claw.</p>
               <p>The Vertues of this Heroe, and the rich endowments of his mind were ſo many, that to commemorate them would take up no leſs ſpace then the whole courſe of life; thoſe faculties which you ſhall finde in other men, though not of the meaneſt parts, to lie diſſever'd and ſolitary, in him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be united, and as it were joyn'd in Wedlock: theſe were a <hi>ready and acute wit, a faithfull memory, a penetrating judgement, and a flowing eloquution.</hi> Of the former three his Books abundantly teſtifies, of which (as <hi>Hirtius</hi> ſaith of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>) <hi>As well and truly others may judge as we alſo know with what eaſe and celerity he writ them.</hi> But of the fourth, namely his Eloquution, I judge it not amiſs to mention that which I have heard the famous Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> (a man endow'd with ſingular vertues, and who well deſerves to have his judgement rely'd on) once diſcourſing, viz. <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Salisbury <hi>was a good Oratour, but a bad Writer; and contrariwiſe, that the Earl of</hi> Northampton <hi>was a good Writer, but a bad Oratour; but that Sir</hi> Francis Bacon <hi>excell'd in both, as well in ſpeaking as in writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Often came this thought into my minde, that if ever God in theſe laſt times vouchſaft to enlighten any mortal man with a certain ray of humane Science, doubtleſs it was this very man whom he ſo enlightned; for though our
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:116025:159"/>Authour had been a diligent peruſer of Books, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be granted that he took his knowledge out of Books onely, but out of certain principles and notions kindled within, which nevertheleſs he not raſhly, but with great caution and deliberation divulged. That Work of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Novum Organum</hi> (to which he himſelf attributes the firſt place among his works) was certainly no idle dream or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own brain, but as it were a fixt and radicated notition, the off-ſpring of many years and hard labor. I found among the Archives of his Lordſhip about a dozen Copies written with his own hand of this <hi>Novum Organum</hi> new la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd, and brought back to the Forge from year to year; and every year more exactly poliſht and corrected, until at length it grew up to that Volume in which it was publiſht: juſt as ſome ſort of creatures are wont to lick their young ones, until ſuch time as they bring them to a certain form and firmneſs of members. In the compoſing of his Books he chiefly aim'd at the life and vigour of expreſſion, and perſpicuity of Words, rather then Elegancy or the quaint order of Phraſe; and as he was writing or dictating he would often ask whether his ſenſe was very clear and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly rendred, as one who knew it to be equal that <hi>words</hi> ſhould wait upon <hi>things,</hi> not <hi>things</hi> upon <hi>words;</hi> and if by chance he had lighted upon a more polite ſtile then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (as among us he was ever counted a grand maſter of Engliſh Eloquence) it therefore happened as being a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing for him to ſhun it; for he was not overmuch ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſubtilties and alluſions of words, but alwayes ſet himſelf induſtriouſly to avoid them, well knowing that ſuch kinde of vanities were nothing elſe but deviations or wandrings from the intended aim, and that they did not a little hurt and detract from the gravity and dignity of ſtile. When he us'd to read he would not dwell ſo long upon a Book, as to glut or weary himſelf; for though he read much, yet it was with great judgement and a rejection of all
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:116025:159"/>the <hi>Refuſe</hi> that commonly we ſhall meet withal in moſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yet he ſtill intermingled with his ſtudies a convenient relaxation of minde, as <hi>gentle walking, riding in a Coach, or on a Horſe,</hi> and that not ſwift but leaſurely, <hi>playing at Bowls,</hi> and other exerciſes of the like nature; nor did he give way to the loſs of any time, for as ſoon as he returned home, he preſently and without the leaſt delay ſet himſelf afreſh to reading and meditation, ſo that he ſuffered not any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or particle of time to periſh or paſs away in vain.</p>
               <p>His Table you might well call a repaſt for the ears as well as for the belly, not unlike thoſe <hi>Attick Nights, or the Banquets of the Deipnoſophiſts,</hi> at which men might feaſt their mindes and intellects no leſs then their bodies. I have alſo known ſome men of excellent wit, who profeſs that they betook themſelves to their Common-place books as often as they aroſe from his Table. He never counted it any glory to baffle or put to the bluſh any of his gueſts or thoſe that diſcourſt with him, as ſome delight to do; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their parts or faculties were, he was ſtill ready to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and help them forward: nor was it his cuſtom to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to himſelf onely the liberty of ſpeech, but to permit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that ſate with him the freedom of ſpeaking when ever it came to their turn, adding this alſo, that he would moſt willingly hear any one diſcourſe in his own Art, and was ſtill forward to incite and draw him on to that manner of diſcourſe; as for himſelf he contemn'd no mans obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor was he aſham'd to light his own Lamp at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Candle.</p>
               <p>His ſpeeches and common ſayings were ſcarce ever called in doubt, as he diſcourſt all heard him willingly, no man oppoſing, as if the things he uttered had been rather Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles then ſayings; which I judge muſt be attributed, either to the exact weighing of his words before he uttered them in the ballance of truth and reaſon, or elſe to the eſteem that all men had of him. Whence that kinde of argumentation, in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:116025:160"/>which a controverſie was held <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> his Table was ſcarce acquainted with; or if any ſuch by chance did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, it was manag'd with great ſubmiſſion and moderation.</p>
               <p>I have aften obſerv'd, and it was taken notice of by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble perſons, that if haply any occaſion fell out into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of repeating another mans ſpeech, he was ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with a way to bring it forth in a new and better dreſs; ſo that the Author of it might perceive his own <hi>ſaying</hi> brought to him back again more elegantly apparell'd then when he ſent it from him, although in ſenſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance no whit injur'd; as if to uſe handſome forms of ſpeaking were a thing planted in him by nature: not unlike what <hi>Ovid</hi> in the buſineſs of compoſing Verſe ſung of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <q>What ere I try'd to write became a Verſe.</q>
               <p>As aften as he was conſtrain'd by his Office to condemn any guilty perſon (which duty was incumbent upon him, as being learned Councel to the Kings majeſty) whether in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal matters of a leſſer nature, or in capital offences, he never carried himſelf proud or lofty towards the delinquent, but always milde and of a moderate temper: and though he knew that it was his duty in behalf of the King to urge and aggravate the crime, as much as in him lay againſt the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſon, yet he ſo carried himſelf, that at the ſame time he lookt upon the fact with an eye of ſeverity, upon the perſon with an eye of mercy. In matters of State when he was called into the Kings Privy Council, he ever obſerv'd the beſt manner of counſelling, not ingaging his maſter in any raſh counſels, or ſuch as were grievous to the people, but rather temporate and equal; inſomuch as King <hi>James</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him with this teſtimony, <hi>That he knew the method of handling matters after a milde and gentle manner;</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly expreſt himſelf, that it was a thing highly pleaſing to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Nor was he when occaſion ſerv'd leſs gracious with the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:116025:160"/>Subjects of the Kingdom, then with the King himſelf; he was ever ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acceptable to the Parliamentary Committees (while he ſate there) of the Lower Houſe, in which he often made Speeches with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. After he was advanc't to the office of Atturney General, and elected to ſit in Parliament, liberty was granted to him, by common ſuffrage, of ſitting in conſultation among them; a thing not known to have been granted to any other Atturney General.</p>
               <p>And as he had the praiſe of a good Servant towards his Maſter, (for as much as in nineteen years adminiſtration, as he himſelf affirm'd, he never incurr'd the Kings diſpleaſure for any offence immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Kings Majeſty) ſo he obtained the name of a good Maſter towards his own Servants, and freely rewarded their diligent ſervices with eminent <hi>Offices,</hi> as often as they came into his power to beſtow, which was a main cauſe why he was almoſt wearied with prayers to receive into the number of his Pages ſo many young men of the better ſort, and ſprung from noble families; and if any of them abus'd his grace and favour, that was onely to be attributed to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his native goodneſs, though it redounds to their perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and intemperance.</p>
               <p>This our worthy was a ſtrict worſhiper of the Divine Majeſty, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath been a cuſtom among the vulgar to brand political per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and men of eminent wits with the note of Atheiſm, yet that he both acknowledg'd and worſhipt God, appears moſt evidently by various te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies diſperſed through the whole courſe of his Works; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he had deſtroyed and overthrown his own principles, which were, <hi>That Philoſphy onely ſipt and ſlightly taſted of, draws us from God, as that which magnifies ſecond cauſes beyond their due; but that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy taken in a full draught brings us at length back unto God.</hi> Now that he himſelf was a very profound Philoſopher, there is no man I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that can deny; nor is this all, but he was likewiſe both able and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>to render an account of that hope which was in him to any one that deſired it;</hi> and of this, <hi>that Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> ſet forth at the end of his <hi>Volumne</hi> hath left a ſufficient proof. He very frequently us'd (when he was in perfect health to be preſent at Divine ſervice, whether pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately or publickly celebrated, at the <hi>hearing of Sermons, at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the holy Euchariſt,</hi> and at length he quietly ſlept in the true <hi>Faith</hi> eſtabliſht in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is to be affirm'd for a certain, that he was utterly void of all malice, which as he ſaid himſelf, <hi>he never brought forth nor nouriſht;</hi> of the revenging of injuries he never ſo much as thought, ſince to the performance thereof, had he been ſo diſpoſed, he was ſufficiently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, both with opportunity and power. A remover of Officers from their places, he was not in the leaſt manner, although he might have inricht himſelf by the deſtruction and ruine of others: nor did he ever bear the name of a calumniator of any man to his Prince. On a
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:116025:161"/>certain day, when one of the chief Miniſters of State, who had borne him no good will, being lately dead; the King askt him what he thought of that Lord who was dead, he anſwered, <hi>That he was ſuch a one as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had promoted his Majeſties Affairs, or made them better; but that doubtleſs he had done his beſt to keep them from ſinking or declining.</hi> This was the hardeſt Sentence he would utter concerning him, which indeed I reckon not among his Morall but his Chriſtian vertues.</p>
               <p>His name was more celebrated &amp; ſhin'd brighter abroad amongſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, then at home among his own Countreymen; as it is mentioned in holy Writ, <hi>A Prophet is not without honour, except in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in his own Houſe.</hi> To make this good, I ſhall produce a little paſſage out of an Epiſtle ſent from <hi>Italy</hi> (the ſhop of polite Wits) to the late Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> at that time Baron <hi>Candiſh,</hi> which was thus. <hi>The new Eſſays of the Lord Chancellor</hi> Bacon, <hi>as alſo his Hiſtory, and whatſoever beſides he is now about, I ſhall expect with infinite thirſt of mind, but eſpecially in his History I promiſe to my ſelf a perfect and well poliſht work, and chiefly in the Affairs of</hi> Henry <hi>the Seventh; in the relating of which, he will have liberty to exerciſe the gift of his accute wit. That Lord daily increaſeth in fame, and his Works are more and more in chocie requeſt among us, and thoſe who in humane Affairs are wiſe above the vulgar, repute him among the greateſt and moſt ſublime wits of the age, and ſo in truth he is.</hi> Many of his Books were taught other languages, as well the ancient and modern, both heretofore and of late by thoſe of forreign Nations. Divers eminent men, while he was living, came over into <hi>England</hi> for no other cauſe but onely to ſee him, and to have an opportunity of diſcourſing with him; upon one of whom he beſtowed his Picture drawn whole at length from head to foot to carry back with him into <hi>France;</hi> which he thankfully receiv'd, as a thing that would be very grateful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to his Countreymen; that ſo they might enjoy the Image of his Perſon as well as the Images of his Brain, viz. his Book. Among others the Marqueſs of <hi>Fiat</hi> a Nobleman in <hi>France,</hi> (who came Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour into <hi>England</hi> in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s comming over, the Wife of King <hi>Charles</hi>) was affected with a very earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſeeing him; whereunto having gain'd an opportunity, and coming into his Bed-chamber where he lay ſick of of the Gout, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt himſelf to him with a very high Complement; as <hi>that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had alwayes been to him like the Angels of whom he had heard and read many things, but that it had never been in his power to ſee them.</hi> From the time of which meeting ſuch amity was contracted between them, and ſo great a veneration the Marqueſs had for him, that beſides frequent viſitations they held a conſtant correſpondence in Letters, ſaluting one another by the name and title of Father and Son. Not to mention here thoſe innumerable Commendations ſent him in Epiſtles from the moſt eminent men of Forreign Nations, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:116025:161"/>to the ſtudy of Wiſdom and good Arts, it being a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with others of note and fame.</p>
               <p>But now that I diſcourſe of his Fame, I would to be underſtood as if I writ in a ſtile not excluſive but comparative; for his Fame ever among the Engliſh was not faint or drooping, but lively and vigorous, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among thoſe that were conſpicuous for their acute and ſublime parts; of which I ſhall inſert two teſtimonies, and no more. The firſt is this, When his Hiſtory of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh was juſt ready for the Preſs, it was ſent by King <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Fulk</hi> Lord <hi>Brook</hi> to peruſe, who when he had read it all over, ſent it back to the Author with this commendation; <hi>Preſent my reſpects to his Lordſhip, and entreat him from me to have a ſpecial care of buying good Paper and Ink; for this Work of his is excellent above any thing that I have ſeen in this kinde.</hi> The other is the teſtimony of Doctour <hi>Samuel Collins, late Profeſſour of Divinity in the famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Cambridge, <hi>and Maſter of</hi> Kings Colledge, a man of no vulgar wit, who (whether pleaſantly or ſeriouſly) affirmed to me, <hi>That after he had read his Book of the Advancement of Learning, he thought himſelf driven to that paſs, that he muſt be forc't to renew the whole courſe of his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from the very beginning, and that all this while he had but loſt his labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was earneſtly deſir'd by ſome, that I would inſert ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Diet, and the government of his Health,</hi> in regard that becauſe of his univerſal knowledge in natural things, his example might be a guide to others. As to his Diet therefore he us'd rather a full and liberal way of feeding, according as he found his ſtomach able to bear, then thin and ſparing; which way he hath alſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſome places of his <hi>Hiſtory of Life and Death.</hi> In his younger years he fed chiefly upon the more delicate and light ſort of meats, as the fleſh of Fowls, and the like; but afterwards having learned more experience, he rather approved of ſtronger meat, ſuch as is ſold in the <hi>ſhambles,</hi> as that which would ſupply the body with more firm and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial juyce, and (that I may uſe his own words) leſs diſſipable, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which alone he himſelf would often feed, although his Table were furniſhed with variety of all ſorts of diſhes; you may well think that he did not in the leaſt manner neglect that which you ſhall finde him to have ſo often cry'd up in his writings, namely the often uſe of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, whereof he took every day in the morning, about three grains in a meſs of thin warm Broth, and this courſe he continued for thrity years at leaſt before his death. As for his uſe of Phyſick, it is true that he lived medicinably but not miſerably, for once in ſix or ſeven dayes, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually took a dram and a half of Rubarb, and no more, infus'd and macerated for the ſpace of half an hour in a draught of Ale and White-wine mixt together; and that a little before meat (either dinner or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) to keep his body from drying up, ſince as he affirm'd it would
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:116025:162"/>carry away the excrementitious humours of the body, and not cauſe the ſpirits to exhale, as frequent ſweating uſeth to do. Now certainly to take ſo little Phyſick as this could not be miſerable, but for any other medicaments, whatſoever hath been vulgarly reported, he would not at all accuſtom himſelf to them. The remedy againſt the Gout, which he himſelf diſcovered, and which he found by experience would aſſwage the pain in two hours ſpace, is extant at the end of his Natural Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>It is likely that at his Nativity the Moon held ſome principal place, as in the Horoſcope or Mid-heaven; for as oft as the Moon was in the wane or ſuffered an Eclipſe, he was taken with a ſudden faintneſs or depreſſion of ſpirit, and this would happen though he had had no knowledge beforehand of the Moons defect; but as ſoon as the Moon had begun to recover her former light, he preſently grew well again.</p>
               <p>He died on the 9th. day of <hi>April, MDCXXVI,</hi> very early in the morning, being the day before the feaſt of the Reſurrection of our Lord, commonly called <hi>Eaſter Eve,</hi> in the ſixty ſixth year of his age, at the Earl of <hi>Arundels</hi> Houſe at <hi>High-gate,</hi> a Village near <hi>London;</hi> to which place he came about eight dayes before, not with an intent to make any abode there, but onely for his pleaſure and recreations ſake: but God ſo ordained it, that in this place he ſhould end his dayes. It was of a lingering Ague that he died, together with a ſtrong Catarrh, which cauſed ſo violent a defluction of humours to his breſt, that by a ſudden ſuffocation the paſſage of his life was intercepted. He was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Church near St. <hi>Albans,</hi> a place deſtin'd for his Sepulchre upon ſome grand conſiderations; as both becauſe the body of his Mother lay buried in the ſame Church, as becauſe that Church is the onely place remaining at this day, out of the ruines of old <hi>Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam.</hi> Here a famous Monument of white Marble was built to his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (by the care and gratitude of <hi>Sir</hi> Thomas Mutes, <hi>adminiſtrator of his laſt Will and Teſtament, heretofore Secretary to his Lordſhip, and afterwards Clerk to the Privy Council under two Kings</hi>) having upon it his Effigies in a poſture ſitting in a chair, and intent upon his ſtudy; together with an Epitaph, which that moſt elegant and polite perſon Sir <hi>Henry Wootton</hi> compoſed, out of the reverence and admiration which he bare to his memory.</p>
               <p>But though his Body which he put off and laid aſide were mortal, yet his Books and Fame will doubtleſs be everlaſting; and as ſoon will the frame of the Earth be diſſolv'd as they ſtoop to fate: mov'd with the conſideration of which, it ſeem'd good to me to collect, according to my ſlender capacity, theſe memories, ſuch as they are, that I alſo might be ſerviceable to the propagating of his name to poſterity. There are ſome light paſſages and pleaſant Apothegms which I have often Beard diſcourſed of the life of this ever to be honoured Worthy, which as this reverend Doctor thought too low for the Grandeur of Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> to have recorded, I ſubmit to his better determination and have thought fit to ſilence my Pen.</p>

               <p>IT is poetized of the <hi>Thracian Orpheus,</hi> that his Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary was ſo powerful, that with it, he drew the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtones after him, towards the building of <hi>Thebes;</hi> which ſome moralize that his eloquence was ſuch, as attracted the ſenſeleſs and ſtony multitude from Barbariſm, to frame themſelves to a civil and well ordered life. What was ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> may fitly be applied to this learned Biſhop, who with his heavenly Oratory, drew many ſtony ſenſeleſs hearts out of the Captivity of Satan, unto the glorious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. For his perſon we can add nothing to him, to name him is enough to all that knew him, and to read him will be enough to them that knew him not; his piety being ſuch as was eſteemed comparable to that which was found in the primitive Church.</p>

So that from his youth he declared an extraordinary worth, that he was made up of learning and vertue; in both of them ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that it was hard to judge which had the precedency
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:116025:163"/>and greater intereſt; though it was truly aſſerted from his contemporaries, that there was not any kinde of Learning that he was a ſtranger to, but in his profeſſion admirable; which was as well if not better known abroad then admired at home.</p>
               <p>Having under theſe two gained an excellent knowledge in the Greek and Hebrew Languages, he was ſent to <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was by Doctor <hi>Wats</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> a Benefactor to that houſe, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in one of the Greek Schollarſhips: ſoon after he was made Bachellour of Arts, and a Fellowſhip being void, he and <hi>Thomas Dove</hi> (afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Peterburgh</hi>) for the obtaining thereof, were put to a trial of ſome Schollaſtical exerciſes; upon performance whereof, they choſe him into the fellowſhip; yet ſo well did they approve of his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that they made him ſome allowance for his preſent maintenance, under the title of a <hi>Tanquam Socius.</hi> Thus this great miracle of worth that arrived to ſuch a fulneſs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial learning, had yet room enough left him in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his brain for almoſt all Languages to ſeat themſelves; ſo that his learning had all the helps that Language could afford, and his language learning enough for the beſt of them to expreſs: ſo that it might be ſaid of him as it was of <hi>Claudius Druſus,</hi> that he was a man of great parts as mortal nature could receive, or induſtry make perfect.</p>
               <p>In proceſs of time his endowments made him ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that he was invited unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Hugh Price,</hi> who built the ſame; whoſe decerning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit preſaging of his future abilities, nominated him in his foundation to be one of his firſt Fellows there; and having taken the degree of Maſter of Art, he applied himſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſtudy of Divinity. Soon after was he choſen Catechiſt in the Colledge, which he performed ſo well, that not onely the Univerſity became his common auditors, but many out of the Countrey reſorted thither, greatly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at his profound learning.</p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:116025:163"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> hearing of his worth, ſent for him, to accompany him into the North (whereof he was Preſident;) where by his painful preaching, he converted many Recuſants to the Proteſtant Religion. And now his abilities being ſtill better known to the world, Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> (Secretary of State to Queen <hi>Elizaheth</hi>) took ſpecial notice of him, and by his means he was preferred to be Vicar of Saint <hi>Giles</hi> without <hi>Cripple-Gate London;</hi> then Prebend and Reſidentiary of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and afterwards Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend of the Collegiate Church of <hi>Southwell;</hi> ſoon after up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of Doctor <hi>Fulk,</hi> he was elected into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip of <hi>Pembroke-hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Afterwards he was made Chaplain in ordinary to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who took ſuch delight in his preaching, that ſhe reſolved upon his higher preferment: but having made him firſt Prebend, and not long after Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> death prevented her of her intentions.</p>
               <p>But what was wanting in her, was performed by her learned ſucceſſour King <hi>James;</hi> who admiring him for his tranſcendent abilities: (ſoon after his coming to this Crown) made him Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and Lord Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and withal added the parſonage of <hi>Cheyham</hi> in <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> to his Commendam.</p>
               <p>He now as he excelled moſt of his Brethren in dignity, he thought it not enough, unleſs he did more then imitate them in ſanctity of life; and knowing no better rule for his direction herein, then what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had preſcribed to <hi>Timothy;</hi> he reſolved to make thoſe precepts his rules of practice. In theſe addreſſes of his to Heaven, firſt, he led his life (as in reſpect to men) blameleſs; his vertues ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by all, but imitated of few: his life being like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſet on a candleſtick, which gave light to the whole Houſe; drawing many ſouls to God as well by his holy converſation, as pious preaching. It is a true ſaying. <hi>A mans pious carriage makes his ſpeech perſwaſive.</hi> Secondly his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:116025:164"/>was moſt tranſcendent, to paſs over many vaſt ſums, he beſtowed upon poor Pariſhes, Priſons, and Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his private Alms in his laſt ſix years (beſides thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique) amounted to the ſum of 1300. pounds and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Notwithſtanding by what hath been ſaid he might ſeem in his life time to be his own Almoner, yet extended he his works of compaſſion moſt abundantly at his death, leaving four thouſand pounds to purchaſe two hundred pounds land <hi>per annum</hi> for ever, to be diſtributed by fifty pounds quarterly thus; to aged poor men fifty pounds, to poor widdows, the wives of one husband, fifty pounds to the binding of poor Orphans Apprentices, fifty pounds; and to the relief of poor priſoners, fifty pounds. Alſo he gave two hundred pounds to poor Maid-ſervants of honeſt report, who had ſerved one Maſter or Miſtreſs ſeven years, to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted preſently after his deceaſe. Many other acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity did this good Biſhop do; a fair coppy for new ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich Cleargy-men, who are all for the mountain word of Faith, but have nothing to do with good Works to write after.</p>
               <p>He had alwayes a ſpecial care of promoting ſufficient and able men to Livings; a great mans letter will do but little good with him, if he ſaw not piety as well as perſonage in the party. His enquiry was conſtantly to know what hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful young men were in the Univerſity, and on them he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the preferments which fell in his gift; thus he weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their merits in the Balance. His own manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being no leſs wiſe then eloquent; ſo he would have men of his profeſſion to be poſſeſſed with a Chriſtian and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious wiſdom to preſerve peace and truth together. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs as he underſtood his own qualifications, he the better knew what men of his function were able to perform. And though his improvements were admirable, after he was Vicar of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> and his diſlikes of all preaching, which by being too frequent, is withal too looſe, thence was
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:116025:164"/>his cenſure on himſelf (recorded by Biſhop <hi>Brockridge</hi> in his Funeral Sermon) that when he preached twice a day at St. <hi>Giles,</hi> he prated once; not but that his very table talk, and what, in the depth of his humility he called his prating, was more uſeful &amp; more learned then the very beſt preaching of them that are enemies to his Glory, as well as Doctrine. But becauſe he thought the word of God was never well enough handled, and that the work of God was never well enough done, until it had received the utmoſt care and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: as Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> excellently diſcourſing of preaching twice a day, commends the neceſſity of a large repitition in the afternoon; which he compares to a diſh of cold meat, which with a little addition will ſuffice thoſe that are not of too greedy appetites, all ear and nothing elſe. Doctor <hi>Dun</hi> renders an excellent reaſon, why ſome are ſo tedious and long-winded in their holding forth; For that, ſaith he, there ware is courſe, they can afford the larger meaſure. But to return to our preſent undertaking, our Biſhops fidelity in his Almoner-ſhip was ſuch, that he would never ſuffer one penny of that which accrewed to him by that place; to be mingled with any of his own Rents or Revenues; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he kept a more exact account then of his own eſtate. And if upon accounts at any time he found any ſurpluſage, he would never ſuffer it to lie by him, but like a faithful Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſtribute the ſame to poor houſholders, and other perſons where he ſaw moſt need.</p>
               <p>But in recounting his vertues, let us not forget to what height they preferred him; having held the Biſhoprick of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> about four years, his Majeſty advanced him to that of <hi>Ely,</hi> wherein he ſat about nine years; in which time he was made a Privy Councellour firſt of <hi>England,</hi> and then of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in his attendance of the King thither. He was afterwards preferred to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and the Deanry of the Kings Chappel; which two laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments he held to the day of his death.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:116025:165"/>
               <p>He was ever faithful, provident, and careful to keep in good repair the Houſes of all his Spiritual Preferments, and ſpent much money that way. As upon the Vicarage Houſe of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> the Prebends and Deans Houſe of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Reſidentiaries Houſe of S. <hi>Pauls.</hi> Upon the houſe belonging to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Chiceſter</hi> he expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded above four hundred and twenty pound: Of <hi>Ely</hi> above two thouſand four hundred and forty pound. Of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> (beſides a Penſion of four hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> from which he freed his See at his own charge) he ſpent two thouſand pound.</p>
               <p>He bequeathed ſeveral Legacies to the Pariſhes of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> Saint <hi>Martins Ludgate,</hi> where he had dwelt, Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> Saint <hi>Saviours</hi> in <hi>Southwark, All-Saints Berking,</hi> where he was born, and others. Alſo to <hi>Pembroke-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> (where he had been a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Fellow, and Maſter) a thouſand pound to purchaſe Land for two Fellowſhips. Beſides three hundred Folio Books of his own, to the encreaſe of their Library; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a gilt Cup, and a Baſon and Ewer of great worth.</p>
               <p>His gratitude to thoſe from whom he had received any benefits was moſt conſpicuous; as Doctour <hi>Ward,</hi> ſon to his firſt School-maſter, upon whom he beſtowed the Living of <hi>Waltham</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire.</hi> Maſter <hi>Mulcaſter</hi> his other School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter he alwayes reverendly reſpected living, and being dead cauſed his Picture (having but few other in his Houſe) to be ſet over his Study door. Upon a Kinſman of Doctor <hi>Wats</hi> (which was all he could finde of that Generation) he beſtowed preferments in <hi>Pembroke-Hall.</hi> But ſhould I go about to particularize all his Vertues, it were ſufficient of its ſelf to make up a Volumn.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Craſhaw,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Herbert</hi> of our late Times, write theſe following Verſes in Latine and Engliſh on the Biſhop; ſome of which are placed before his Picture to his Sermons.</p>

               <head>The Life of Doctour DONNE Dean of PAULS.</head>
               <p>THis Worthy Prelate, whoſe Learning hath made him deſervedly famous, was born in <hi>London,</hi> extracted by his Fathers ſide from an ancient and worſhipful Family in <hi>Wales,</hi> and by his Mother from the learned Sir <hi>Thomas
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:116025:167"/>Moor,</hi> and the laborious Judge <hi>Raſcal,</hi> thoſe two great Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Law and Learning. His firſt Education was in his Fathers houſe, where a private Tutour had the care of him; under whom he ſo profited, that at nine years of age he was ſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> having beſides the Latine and Greek, attained to a knowledge of the French Tongue; Languages which few Children underſtand at that age; nay, many ſcarcely their own.</p>
               <p>Remaining in <hi>Hart-Hall</hi> (having for the advancement of his ſtudies Tutours in ſeveral Sciences to inſtruct him) he in ſhort time advanced to ſuch a height of Learning, as decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him fit to receive his firſt degree in the Schools: but his Parents being of the Romiſh perſwaſion, conſcionably averſe to ſome parts of the Oath, dehorted him from it; whoſe advice as Paternal Commands, he dutifully obeyed. Here fell he in acquaintance with that great Maſter of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Art, Sir <hi>Henry Wootton,</hi> betwixt whom was ſuch friendſhip contracted, that nothing but death could force the ſeparation.</p>
               <p>And now (like a laborious. Bee deſirous to gather honey from more flowers then one) he was tranſplanted from <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> (our other renowned Nurſery of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) where he much improved his ſtudies, but took no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for the reaſons formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>Being about ſeventeen years of age, his Father died, who left him three thouſand pound in ready money his mother and thoſe to whoſe care he was committed, willing he ſhould be able to manage ſuch an eſtate, took him from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and placed him in <hi>Lincolns-Inne;</hi> where for the improvement of his knowledge, they provided him Tutors in ſeveral Sciences, as the Mathematicks and others; but with theſe they had inſtructions alſo, to inſtil into him the Principles of the Romiſh Church. And indeed they ſo wrought with him, (having for their advantage, beſides their opportunity, the example of his moſt dear and pious
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:116025:168"/>Parents) that they had almoſt obliged him unto their faith. But rectifying his judgements by the holy Scriptures, and conferring Papiſts and Proteſtants Works together he was not onely drawn off from their Opinions, but more ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledly grounded in the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>And now having a youthful deſire to travel, and a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by occaſion of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> going to <hi>Cales,</hi> he embraced the advantage, and went along with him; and having ſeen the iſſue of that expedition, left them and went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Spain;</hi> where by his induſtry he attained to a perfection in their Languages, and returned home with many uſeful obſervations of thoſe Countreys, their Laws, and Government.</p>
               <p>Soon after his return the Lord <hi>Elſmore,</hi> Lord Keeper of the great Seal, and after Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> taking notice of his abilities, entertain'd him for his chief Secretary, in whoſe ſervice he fell in love with a young Gentlewoman who lived in that Family, Neece to the Lady <hi>Elſmore,</hi> and Daughter to Sir <hi>George More,</hi> Chancellour of the Garter, and Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower.</hi> And notwithſtanding her Friends oppoſed, and endeavoured what they could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, yet ſome faithful promiſes having interchangeably paſt betwixt them, they reſolved, and did marry, without the knowledge or advice of thoſe that might juſtly claim an intereſt in the diſpoſing of them.</p>
               <p>But his Father-in-law Sir <hi>Geor. More</hi> was ſo immeaſurably incens'd at what was done, that he not only detained his wife from him, but procured the Lord <hi>Elſmore</hi> to diſcharge him of the place he held under his Lordſhip. And although the Lord Chancellour at his diſmiſſion proteſted he thought him a fitter Secretary for a King then a Subject, yet could not this put a period to Sir <hi>Georges</hi> choller, never leaving till he had caſt him into priſon, as alſo his two ſpecial Friends, Maſter <hi>Samuel Brook,</hi> (who was after D in D. and Maſter of <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi>) who had married
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:116025:168"/>him, and his Brother Maſter <hi>Chriſtopher Brook</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> who gave him his Wife, and witneſſed the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>In the time of Maſter <hi>Donnes</hi> melancholly Impriſonment, how true I know not, onely I have heard it often diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he writ on the window with the point of his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, reflecting on the then preſent affliction of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage theſe words, <hi>John Donne,</hi> done and undone.</p>
               <p>But long were they not there, but Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> got himſelf enlarged, and ſoon after his two Friends; and long it was not ere the edge of his Father-in-laws paſſion was taken off by the advice of ſome Friends, who approved his Daughters choice: and although at preſent he refuſed to contribute any means that might conduce to their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, yet did he beſtow upon them his Paternal Bleſſing, and ſecretly laboured his ſons reſtauration into that place of which his own raſhneſs had bereft him; although it found no ſucceſs. The Lord Chancellour replying, <hi>That though he was ſorry for what he had done, yet it ſtood not with his credit to diſcharge and re-admit Servants at the requeſt of paſſionate Petitioners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> by means of his Father-in-law being brought out of employment, the greateſt part of his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by many and chargeable travels waſted, the reſt disburſt in ſome few Books, and dear bought experience; was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with many and ſad thoughts. <hi>And indeed no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of diſcourteſie ſtrikes ſo deep into a man, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from thoſe where we expect the greateſt courteſies; certainly he who hurts his Son-in-law, cannot chuſe but harm his own Daughter. Neither is it enough for him to ſay he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth him of what he hath done, unleſs withal he endeavor for him a new employment, and allow him maintenace ſo long as he is out of it:</hi> As did this good Knight Sir <hi>George More,</hi> who repenting of his errour gave Maſter <hi>Donne</hi> a Bond to pay him eight hundred pound at a certain day, as a portion
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:116025:169"/>with his Wife, and to pay him for their maintenance twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pound quarterly, (as the Intereſt of it) until the ſaid portion were paid.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Donne</hi> during the time of his Father-in-laws diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, was curteouſly entertained by their noble Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Sir <hi>Francis Wally</hi> of <hi>Pirford,</hi> where he remained many years; who as their charge encreaſed, (for ſhe had yearly a childe) ſo did he encreaſe his love and bounty.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis</hi> dying, he for a while kept houſe at <hi>Micham</hi> near <hi>Croyden</hi> in <hi>Surrey;</hi> but being importuned by his friends, he left <hi>Micham,</hi> and had a convenient houſe aſſigned him by that honourable Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Drury,</hi> next his own, in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> who not onely gave him his dwelling rent free but was alſo a daily cheriſher of his ſtudies.</p>
               <p>And now was he frequently viſited by men of greateſt learning and judgement in this kingdom; his company de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the Nobility, and extreamly affected by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; his friendſhip was ſought for of moſt forreign Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, and his acquaintance entreated by many other ſtrangers, whoſe learning or employment occaſioned their ſtay in this kingdom. Divers of the Nobility interceeded for his preferment at Court, and great hopes was given him of ſome State employment; his Majeſty having formerly known and much valued him, was much pleaſed to hear his learned diſputes, frequently uſed as they ſat at meals. About this time was that great diſpute in <hi>England,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, in which the King had ingaged himſelf; who talking occaſionly with Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> concerning ſome arguments urged by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, received ſuch ſatisfactory anſwers, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to ſtate the points, and bring his reaſons to him in writing; which within ſix weeks he performed, with ſuch contentment to the King, that he perſwaded him to enter into the Miniſtery; to which Mr. <hi>Donne</hi> ſeemed to be modeſtly unwilling, his modeſty apprehending it too
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:116025:169"/>weighty for his abilities; his friends alſo (knowing how his education had apted him) mediated with his Majeſty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to ſome civil employment: but the King having a deſcerning ſpirit, replyed, <hi>I know Mr.</hi> Donne <hi>is a learned man, will prove an excellent Divine, and a powerful Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Which cauſed this learned King again to ſollicit him to enter into Sacred Orders, which yet he deferred for the ſpace of three years, applying himſelf in the mean time to an inceſſant ſtudy of Textual Divinity, and attained to an admirable perfection in the Greek and Hebrew Tongues.</p>
               <p>Soon after his entring into this holy profeſſion, the King made him his Chaplain in ordinary; he attending his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in his progreſs to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Univerſity (knowing his worth) with a univerſal conſent; made him Doctor in Divinity. Immediately after his return home, his Wife dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaving him the careful Father of ſeven Children living, (having buried five) to her he promiſed never to bring them under the ſubjection of a ſtep-mother; and although his age being but forty two years, might promiſe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet kept he his word faithfully, burying with his moſt dear and deſerving Wife, all his ſublunary joyes in this world, and living a retired life, applyed himſelf wholly to the exerciſe of Divinity.</p>
               <p>And now his preaching and godly converſation was grown ſo eminent, that fourteen Advowſions of ſeveral Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices were offered unto him in the Countrey; but he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a natural inclination to <hi>London</hi> his Birth-place, refuſed them, and accepted of a Lecture at <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> being glad to renew his intermitted friendſhip with them; where he continued for the ſpace of three years, conſtantly and faithfully diſpenſing the word of God; and they as freely requiting him with a liberal maintenance. About which time the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> uſurping the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> much trouble aroſe in thoſe kingdoms; for the compoſing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the King ſent the Earl of <hi>Carlile,</hi> (then Viſcount <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi>)
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:116025:170"/>his Ambaſſador to thoſe unſettled Princes, and by a ſpecial command from his Majeſty, Doctor <hi>Donne</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to go along with him, which accordingly he did; to the great comfort of that vertuous Lady the Queen of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> who very gladly received him as the Ambaſſadour of Chriſt; and during his abode there, being a conſtant hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his moſt excellent and powerful preaching.</p>
               <p>Within fourteen moneths he returned home, and about a year after his return; the Deanry of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> being vacant by the removal of Doctor <hi>Cary</hi> to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Exeter,</hi> the King beſtowed the ſame upon him: at his entrance into the Deanry he repaired the Chappel belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his houſe, <hi>Suffering</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt hath it) <hi>his eyes and temples to take no reſt, untill he had firſt beautified the houſe of God.</hi> Soon after the Vicarage of Saint <hi>Dunſtans</hi> in <hi>London</hi> fell to him by the death of Doctor <hi>White,</hi> with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Eccleſiaſtical endowment, about the ſame time. Thus God bleſſed him, that he was enabled to be Charitable to the Poor. His Father-in-law Sir <hi>George More</hi> coming to pay him the conditioned ſum of twenty pound, he refuſed it, ſaying, as good <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid when he heard his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> lived, <hi>It is enough, you have been kinde to me, and careful of my Children, and I thank my God I am provided for; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will receive it no longer: and not long after freely gave up his Bond of eight hundred pounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as envy is alwayes attendant on the beſt deſerving, ſo did ſome malicious perſon whiſper in the Kings ear, that Doctor <hi>Donne</hi> had preacht a Sermon that implied a diſlike of his Government; the King herewith incens'd, ſent for him, to anſwer the accuſation; which was ſo ſatisfactory, as gave the King exceeding great content; who with much earneſtneſs ſaid to ſome of his Councel, <hi>My Doctor is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was made Dean in the fiftieth year of his age, and in the fifty fourth year a dangerous ſickneſs ſeized him, which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:116025:170"/>turned to a ſpotted Feaver, and ended in a Cough, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him to a Conſumption. During this ſickneſs he wrote this heavenly Hymn, expreſſing the great joy he then had in the aſſurance of Gods mercy to him.</p>

               <p>But it pleaſed God to reſtore him to his health, and to adde unto his life five years more. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1630. being with his Daughter Miſtreſs <hi>Harvy</hi> at <hi>Abrey-hatch</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he fell into a Feaver, which with the help of his conſtant infirmity, <hi>vapors from the Spleen,</hi> brought him into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; yet notwithſtanding his diſability, the firſt Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in Lent being come, (which was his old conſtant day
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:116025:171"/>he was appointed to preach on) he reſolved not to decline that ſervice: and although ſome of his Friends perſwaded him from undertaking it, fearing it might be a means to ſhorten his dayes, he paſſionately denied their requeſts, ſaying, <hi>He would not doubt, that God who in many weakneſſes had aſſiſted him with an unexpected ſtrength, would now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it in his laſt employment.</hi> His Text was; <hi>To God the Lord belong the iſſues from death.</hi> Many that ſaw his tears, and heard his hollow voice, profeſſing they thought the Text prophetically choſen, and that Doctour <hi>Donne</hi> had preacht his own Funeral Sermon.</p>
               <p>He would often deſire, if that God would be pleaſed to grant it, that he might die in the Pulpit; if not that, yet that he might take his death in the Pulpit; that is, die the ſooner by occaſion of thoſe labours. And indeed we may juſtly conceive that God granted his requeſts; for after his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was over, haſtening to his houſe, he never moved out of it, until like St. <hi>Stephen, He was carried by devout men to the grave.</hi> During the time of his ſickneſſe, his ſpirits being much ſpent, which made him unapt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, a Friend asked him, Why are you ſad? to whom he replyed after this manner; <q>I am not ſad, I am in a ſerious contemplation of the mercies of my God to me; and now I plainly ſee, it was his hand that prevented me from all temporal employment. And I ſee it was his will that I ſhould never ſettle nor thrive until I entered into the Miniſtery; in which I have now lived almoſt twenty years, (I hope to his glory) and by which (I moſt humbly thank him) I have been enabled to requite moſt of thoſe friends that ſhewed me kindeneſs when my fortunes were low. And (as it hath occaſioned the expreſſion of my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) I thank God, moſt of them have ſtood in need of my requital. I have been uſeful and comfortable to my good father-in-law Sir <hi>George More,</hi> whoſe patience God hath been pleaſed to exerciſe by many temporal croſſes. I
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:116025:171"/>have maintained my own Mother, whom it hath pleaſed God after a plentiful fortune in her former times, to bring to a great decay in her very old age. I have quieted the conſciences of many that groaned under the burthen of a wounded ſpirit, whoſe prayers I hope are available for me. I cannot plead innocency of life, (eſpecially of my youth) but I am to be judged of a merciful God, who hath given me (even at this time) ſome teſtimonies by his holy Spirit, that I am of the number of his elect. I am full of joy, and ſhall die in peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He lay fifteen dayes earneſtly expecting his hourly change; his ſpeech which had long been his faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, remained with him till his laſt minute. In his very laſt hour (as his body melted away and vapourated into ſpirit) his ſoul having ſome revelation of the beatifical viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſaid; <hi>I were miſerable if I might not die.</hi> And after many periods of his faint breath, with theſe words, <hi>Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done,</hi> he rendred up his ſoul to him that gave it him.</p>
               <p>He was buried in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, attended with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons of Nobility and Eminency; after his burial ſome mournful friends repaired, and as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did to the grave of the moſt famous <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſo they ſtrewed his with curious and coſtly flowers. Nor was this (though not uſual) all the honour done to his reverend aſhes, for ſome perſon (unknown) to perpetuate his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſent to his two Executors, Doctour <hi>King,</hi> and Doctour <hi>Montford,</hi> an hundred Marks towards the making of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument for him; which they faithfully performed, it being as lively a repreſentation, as in dead Marble can be made of him.</p>
               <p>The recreation of his youth were Poety, in which he was ſo happy, as if Nature with all her varieties had been made to exerciſe his great wit, and high fancy: nor did he leave it off in his old age, as is witneſſed by many of his Divine

               <head>The Life of GEORGE VILLERS Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TAll Cedars are ſhaken with the wind, when the humble ſhrub reſts ſecure; Envy ſtrikes not at the lowly perſon, her aim is evermore at the talleſt. How vain then is that man, who enjoying the quiet of a retired life, ambitiouſly hunts after honour? How few Favorites go to the grave in
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:116025:172"/>peace, Hiſtories make mention, and this Age can teſtify: this truth will be too ſadly inſtanced in the late Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who from the mean eſtate of a private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman being raiſed to the higheſt pitch of honour a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject could be capable of came at laſt to an untimely end.</p>
               <p>His firſt riſe began at the Earl of <hi>Somerſets</hi> fall, one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom King <hi>James</hi> had heaped many great favours; for from the degree of a Knight he was firſt made Viſcount <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> next ſworn a Privy Councellour, then created Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and laſt of all made Lord Chamberlane. But this ſerene Sky of favour was ſoon over-ſhadowed with Clouds by the Earls undeſerving; for having married the Lady <hi>Frances Howard,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and not long before divorced from the Earl of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> the unfortunate Knight Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> for ſpeaking againſt the match, was by their procurement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and not long after poyſoned, as I have more at large treated of in his Life; for which fact both the Lady and Earl were arraigned and condemned, yet through the Kings great clemency had their lives ſpared, but were for ever baniſht his preſence.</p>
               <p>This great Favorite being thus diſguſted, King <hi>James,</hi> who would not long be without an <hi>alter idem,</hi> or Boſom-friend, took into ſpecial regard, as I have intimated, Maſter <hi>George Villers,</hi> (a Gentleman of a good extraction, but a younger Brother) and finding him ſuſceptible, and of good form, moulded him (Platonically) to his own Idea. And that he might be a fit companion for a King, raiſed him in honour next to himſelf; yet not all at once, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, making him firſt a Knight, and Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, ſoon after a Viſcount, and Maſter of the Horſe; a while after erected Earl of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> then Marqueſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and made Lord Admiral. King <hi>James</hi> having thus hardened and polliſhed him about ten
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:116025:173"/>years in the School of obſervance (for ſo a Court is) and in the furnace of tryal about himſelf, for he was a King that could peruſe men as well as books; he made him the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate of his Heir Apparent, together with the Lord <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> an adjunct of ſingular experience and truſt in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign travel, and in a buſineſs of love and of no equal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, enough to kindle affection even between the diſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conditions; ſo as by various and inward converſation abroad (beſides that before and after at home) with the moſt conſtant and beſt natured Prince <hi>(bana ſi ſua nocint)</hi> that ever any Nation enjoyed, this Duke (which laſt title was conferred on him in <hi>Spain</hi>) now becomes ſeized of reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted favour as it were by deſcent, though the condition of that ſtate commonly be no more then a tenancy at will, or at moſt for the life of the firſt Lord, and rarely tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it being a kinde of wonder to ſee favour hereditary, yet in him it proved far otherwiſe, as one writes.</p>

               <p>And although it be ever the perpetual lot of thoſe who are of choiceſt admiſſion into Princes favours, to feel as ſtrong ſtroaks of envy and ill will from beneath, as they do beams of grace and favour from above; the Princes love procuring the peoples hate: this Duke contrarily found their affection ſo great towards him, that in open Parliament the generality honoured him with no leſſer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, then the preſerver of his Countrey.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:116025:174"/>the authority of our ſaid Sovereign Lord the King aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, do by this their Bill ſhew, and declare againſt <hi>George,</hi> Duke, Marqueſs, and Earl of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Earl of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Villers,</hi> Barron of <hi>Whaddon,</hi> Great Admiral of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of the Dominions and Iſlands of the ſame, of the Town of <hi>Calais,</hi> and of the Marches of the ſame, and of <hi>Normandy, Gaſcoigne,</hi> and <hi>Guyen;</hi> General Governour of the Seas and ſhips of the ſaid Kingdoms; Lieutenant General, Admiral, Captain General, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of his Majeſties Royal Fleet and Army lately ſet forth; Maſter of the Horſes of our Sovereign Lord the King; Lord Warden, Chancellour and Admiral of the Cinque-Ports, and of the members thereof; Conſtable of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle, Juſtice in Eyre of all Forreſts and Chaſes on this ſide <hi>Trent,</hi> Conſtable of the Caſtle of <hi>Windſor;</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Buckinghamſhire;</hi> Steward and Bayliff of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> Gentleman of his Majeſties Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and one of his Majeſties Honourable Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in his Realms, both of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Knight of the moſt noble Order of the Garter.</p>
               <p>The ſame Parliament likewiſe was the Duke accuſed of High Treaſon by the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi> in like manner accuſed of High Treaſon by the Duke; the Factions of both ſides were paſſing jocund at this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, obſerving,. <hi>That whileſt between theſe Grandees mutual malice brake out, truth came to her own.</hi> But that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being broke up abruptly, the people were fruſtrated of their expectations.</p>
               <p>To recover the Dukes reputation, which ſeem'd eclipſed by this charge of High Treaſon, a Navy being made ready for the relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> the Duke was made Commander both by Sea and Land; who endeavouring by his Atchievements to remove all cauſe of calumny againſt him, by the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of that enterprize more exaſperated the hatred of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:116025:174"/>people. The cauſe of this expedition (that we may relate things in order to truth) was as followeth: The French King during the Treaty of Marriage between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> pretending a Martial deſign againſt <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> obtained of King <hi>James</hi> the Loan of the Vant-guard, a parcel of the Navy Royal, and (with the owners conſent) of ſix Merchants Ships more; but a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour being ſpread that thoſe ſhips were intended againſt <hi>Rochel,</hi> then revolted from him, an expreſs caution was put in to the contrary. But before thoſe ſhips ſet out, King <hi>James</hi> died, and the French King and the Rochellers (by the mediation of King <hi>Charles</hi>) came to an accord; but no ſooner was the French Army advanced for <hi>Italy,</hi> but the Rochellers (upon pretence that the King had not kept touch with them in ſlighting <hi>Fort Lewis</hi>) under the leading of <hi>Subize,</hi> ſurprize the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> ſurprize many ſhips in the Harbour, and bad fair for the taking of <hi>Fort Lewis,</hi> had not the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> poſted thither with relief. The French King nettled at this inſolency, began to raiſe an Army, ſets forth all the ſhips he could procure, obtained naval aid of the Dutch, and demanded of Captain <hi>Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> the delivery of the Engliſh ſhips, agreeable to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters promiſe; <hi>Pennington</hi> refuſes to deliver any till a further ſignification of his Majeſties pleaſure: but King <hi>Charles</hi> rather willing to ſubmit to the hazard of <hi>Lewis</hi> his breach of faith, then to the blame of receding from his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, returned anſwer, <hi>That his will was, that he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up his own, and the ſix Merchants ſhips to the ſervice of his Brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With theſe Forces he quickly undoeth what <hi>Subize</hi> had done, forceth him from his ſtrength, reprizeth many of his ſhips, and ſo impetuouſly chaſeth him, as he, with much difficulty, eſcaped to the Iſle of <hi>Oleron.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for the miſimployment of his ſhips, ſent an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulatory meſſage to his Brother, demanding the cauſe of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:116025:175"/>this violation of his Royal Parole; and withal, requiring the reſtitution of his ſhips.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> returneth anſwer, <hi>That the Rochellers had firſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, and ſlighted their faith with him, and that neceſſity enforced him to uſe all means to impede the progreſs of ſo great diſloyalty, which he could not well do without the aid of the Engliſh Ships, his own Fleet being upon other ſervice.</hi> And for the reſtitution of thoſe ſhips he replyed, <hi>That his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by whom they were mann'd, held them contrary to his minde, and therefore wiſht him to come by them as he could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwer nothing pleaſed King <hi>Charles</hi> other diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents alſo ariſing, and <hi>Rochel</hi> being cloſe beleagured by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a Navy was made ready, whereof the Duke was made Admiral, as you have heard. <hi>June</hi> the 27. the year of our Lord 1627. he ſet ſail from <hi>Portſmouth</hi> with about 6000. Horſe and Foot; their deſign was intended againſt <hi>Fort Lewis,</hi> upon the Continent near <hi>Rochel;</hi> but upon a falſe information that the Duke <hi>D' Angouleſm</hi> was there with fifteen thouſand men, (whereas indeed he had but three thouſand Foot, and two hundred Horſe) they altered their determination, and inſtantly directed their courſe towards the Iſle of <hi>Rhee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the 30. early in the morning they ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Iſlands of <hi>Oleron,</hi> to the number of about twenty Sail, being at firſt ſuppoſed to be Dunkerks waiting the motion of the Hollanders then in the road; but upon their nearer approaches toward the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> and that the Hollanders took no Alarm, they were then ſuſpected to be Engliſh. At a certain Fort called <hi>De la Pree</hi> they landed; to the number of 1200. whom to oppoſe <hi>Sieur de Toiras</hi> Governour of the Cittadel of Saint <hi>Martins,</hi> with the like number encountred; the Fight continued fierce and doubtful. On the Engliſh ſide were ſlain Sir <hi>William Heyden,</hi> and <hi>Sieur de Blancard</hi> a French-man, Agent from the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> and the Proteſtants. Of the French,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:116025:175"/>the Governours Brother, and the Barron of <hi>Chuntal;</hi> of common Souldiers on both ſides, about nine hundred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the French bare the greater ſhare; and now having try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a taſte of each others valour, the French retire to their Garriſon, and the Engliſh to their Ships.</p>
               <p>Three dayes together both ſides lay quiet, as if they had ſpent their whole ſtock of valour at once, or ſworn a truce on both ſides; at length the Duke went on ſhore again, intrenching himſelf, until he had debarqued all his Horſe; and receiving a recruit from <hi>Rochel</hi> of 500. Foot, marcheth directly towards St. <hi>Martins</hi> Fort. Upon his approach the Iſlanders abandoned the Town and fled into the Caſtle: ſo that the Duke being now poſſeſſed of the one, thought it would not be long ere the other was his; but thoſe who reckon without their hoſt (we ſay) muſt reckon twice: two moneths together the Duke encamped before this Fort, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time <hi>Toiras</hi> the Governour had hired a French man to have ſtabbed the Duke; who being taken by the Engliſh, confeſſed his intentions. But what detriment the French could not do the Engliſh by treachery they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed otherwiſe; that gallant Gentleman Sir <hi>John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> being ſlain with a Muſquet ſhot from the Caſtle, as he was viewing the Engliſh Works, whoſe body was after honourably enterred at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> At length the Caſtle was reduced to a condition of yielding, when in the very nick of neceſſity <hi>Mounſier Balin</hi> at an high flood, in the dead of night conveyed in twelve Pinnaces laden with Proviſion, which ſo cheared their drooping ſpirits, that they reſolved to ſtand it out reſolutely, which accordingly they did, till at laſt they were relieved by the Marſhal of <hi>Schomberg;</hi> who with four thouſand Foot, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, landed at <hi>Fort de la Pree,</hi> and undiſcovered, marched up to the view of the Fort, and of the Engliſh. The Duke alarm'd at this ſudden apparition, fearing to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged front and rear, reſolved to riſe and be gone; the French
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:116025:176"/>upon their retreat, came up to the very tail of their rear, hallowing to them in a Bravado: whereupon the Engliſh were drawn up in Battalia, but the French would advance no nearer, until ſpying their advantage, the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go over a narrow paſſage, having ſalt-pits on either ſide, they then came on amain, powring great vollies of ſhot upon the Engliſh; and having routed the Lord <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes</hi> Troops, and taken him priſoner, they fell upon Sir <hi>William Coninghams,</hi> but they moſt bravely fought it out even to the laſt man: had the Lord <hi>Montjoyes</hi> Troops done the like a quarter ſo many had not periſhed; but cowards are foes to their own lives, and gain onely this by running away, to be killed more baſely, and further off from their fellows.</p>
               <p>The rear being thus routed, they fall on upon the main Battel, but Sir <hi>Edward Conways</hi> who commanded the van, facing about, made them retreat; and having left a ſelect company of muſquetiers to guard the paſs until night, they burnt the Bridge, lodging that night in a place called the <hi>Looſe,</hi> and the next day went on board.</p>
               <p>Thus returned home the Engliſh with extream loſs, whereof the Duke as in Command the chief, ſo did he ſhare chiefly in the diſgrace; the French ſcoffingly ſaying, <hi>Though the Duke could not take the</hi> Cittidal <hi>of St.</hi> Martins, <hi>yet it was odds but he would take the</hi> Tower <hi>of</hi> London. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Moor</hi> alſo a Prebend of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> took occaſion in his Sermon to cite that of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in <hi>Cornelius Tacitus, Quintili Vare redde Legiones,</hi> which, ſaith the Hiſtorian periſhed, <hi>propter inſcitiam &amp; temeritatem Ducis,</hi> giving him a quaint wipe the Amphibology of the word <hi>Dux,</hi> thus (as the Poet hath it.)</p>

               </q>
               <p>But the King was not ſo daunted at this diſaſter, but that he reſolved to give one pluck more for the relief of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:116025:176"/>
                  <hi>Rochell;</hi> which the Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi> attempting with ill ſucceſs; a third Fleet was made ready, then which there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before appeared a more gallant Armado formed by our Nation. The Duke deſirous to recover his reputation, much blemiſhed by his diſcomfiture at the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> was by the King made Commander in chief; but before his ſetting forth, being at breakfaſt at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> with <hi>Subize,</hi> and others of principal quality, one <hi>John Felton</hi> (ſometimes a Lieutenant to a Foot Company in the Regiment of Sir <hi>John Ramſey</hi>) watching his opportunity, as the Duke was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through an Entry with Sir <hi>Thomas Frier,</hi> (to whom he declined his ear in the poſture of attention) in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his retiring from the Duke, <hi>Felton</hi> with a knife ſtab'd him on the left ſide into the very heart; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he ſtruck him, <hi>The Lord have mercy upon thy ſoul;</hi> a Speech which the Duke had ſcarce time to ſay for himſelf: ſuch effuſion of blood flowing from the wound after the knife was pulled out, that he preſently expired; being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard to ſay (ſome report with an oath) <hi>The Villain hath killed me.</hi> The motives that induced <hi>Felton</hi> to this execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murther are ſaid to be theſe; he had long, and in vain waited for his arrears of pay, due for former ſervice; again, he was twice repulſed upon his Petition for a Captains place, and others ſuper-inducted over his head. But leaſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate malice ſhould be thought his onely motive to the fact, he declared it to be the late Remonſtrance of the Houſe of Commons; ſticking a paper to the lining of his hat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had written as followeth.</p>

               <p>Many are ſaid to be the warnings the Duke had of his end; ſome two moneths before, one Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> (a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Dukes) was by the rude multitude ſlain in the Streets; they telling him as they were belabouring him with ſtones and cudgels, <hi>That were his Maſter the Duke there, they would give him as much.</hi> This time alſo was common in many mens mouths.</p>

               <p>The ſame day that <hi>Lamb</hi> was ſlain, the Dukes Picture fell down in the High Commiſſion Chamber at <hi>Lambeth.</hi> Theſe with other the like accidents fore-bodeing ſomething of preſent fatality to the Duke, being ſpoken of in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Davis</hi> her hearing, ſhe, for certain reply'd, <hi>No, his time is not come till Auguſt.</hi> The ſame Lady alſo, (as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Gentleman of near relation unto me) did by her ſervant certifie the Duke, that at ſuch time as a Mole, which he had upon his Shoulder, ſhould go away, the Duke ſhould dye; which accordingly came to paſs. But the moſt
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:116025:177"/>ſtrange (if true) is that related by <hi>Lilly</hi> in his Obſervations on the Life and Death of King <hi>Charles,</hi> namely, that a Daemon appeared to one <hi>Parker</hi> in the likeneſs of Sir <hi>George Villers</hi> the Dukes Father, bidding him go and tell his Son, that unleſs he refrained ſuch and ſuch company, he ſhould ere long be killed, and withal ſhewed him a knife, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the act; <hi>Parker</hi> told the Duke of theſe things, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an old man was judged to doat: not long after the Daemon appeared to him again, telling him that the Duke ſhould not long ſurvive; and alſo bid him ſet his own houſe in order for he ſhould ſhortly dye.

               <p>He died the thirty ſixth year of his age, a time which by the courſe of Nature he might have doubled. Never did ſo great a man fall ſo much unlamented, though cauſeleſs, as by the ſucceſs of Affairs wiſe men have ſince deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>

               <head>The Life of Sir HENRY VVOTTON.</head>
               <p>TO ſurvey him at one ſingle proſpect, Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was born at <hi>Bocton-Hall</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent.</hi> in the year of our Redemption 1568. deſcended of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and honourable Family, great cheriſhers of Learning, as appears by that excellent Antiquary Maſter <hi>William Lambert</hi> in his Perambulation of <hi>Kent.</hi> He had three elder Brothers, all Knights, men eminent for Wiſdom and Piety; by all which it appears, that Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> was
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:116025:178"/>a branch of ſuch a Kindred as left a ſtock of reputation to their poſterity.</p>
               <p>His Childehood being ſpent under the tuition of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was ſent to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> School, a place of ſtrict Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Order, that ſo he might in his youth be moulded into a method of living by rule. Where having much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, he was removed from thence to <hi>New Colledge</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> where he remained till about the eighteenth year of his age; from thence tranſplanted into <hi>Queens Colledge,</hi> where to ſhew the world ſome part of his abilities, he writ a Play of the Tragedy of <hi>Tancredo,</hi> which though ſome ſowre diſpoſitions may condemn, yet conſidering his youth, and thoſe weighty ſentences contained in the ſame, it may be thought neither uncomely nor unprofitable.</p>
               <p>During Sir <hi>Henry's</hi> abode at <hi>Oxford,</hi> his Father (being then in <hi>Kent</hi>) dreamed that the Univerſity Treaſury was robbed by five Townſmen and poor Schollars; and being that day to write to his ſon <hi>Henry,</hi> thought it worth ſo much pains, as by a Poſtſcript in his Letter, to make a ſlight enquiry of it: which coming to his hands, the very morning after the night in which the robbery was committed, was by him ſhown, and by means thereof the five guilty perſons diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and apprehended.</p>
               <p>The next year he proceeded Maſter of Arts, at what time he read an Optick Lecture with great applauſe of the Univerſity; eſpecially of thoſe two great Wits, <hi>Albericus Gentilis,</hi> a Learned Italian, and Doctour <hi>Donne</hi> ſometimes Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> of whoſe worth none that but pretends to Learning can be ignorant. With theſe two he entered into a boſome friendſhip, which continued during the term of their lives.</p>
               <p>Attaining now to the age of two and twenty, he left <hi>Oxford,</hi> and betook himſelf to travel, to purchaſe the rich treaſure of forreign knowledge. Almoſt nine years was he abſent from <hi>England,</hi> the moſt of which time he remained
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:116025:178"/>in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> acquainting himſelf with the moſt learned of either Nations. At his return <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (then one of the Darlings of Fortune) who hearing of his abilities, took him to be one of his Secretaries: at the fall of the Earl (with whom fell Maſter <hi>Cuffe</hi> his other Secretary) he privately poſted out of <hi>England,</hi> and went to <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where he met with his old Friend <hi>Siegnior Vietta,</hi> then Secretary to the great Duke of <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> having ſtayed ſome ſhort time there, the Duke inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted certain Letters that diſcovered a deſign to take away the life of the then King of <hi>Scots.</hi> The Duke abhorring the fact, and reſolving to endeavour a prevention of it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed with his Secretary <hi>Vietta,</hi> by what means a caution might be given to that King; and after conſideration it was reſolved to be done by Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> who gladly undertaking the ſame, to avoid the light of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, poſted into <hi>Scotland</hi> by the way of <hi>Norway,</hi> under the name of <hi>Octavio Baldi;</hi> being admitted private audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the King, he was not onely diſcovered wherefore he came, but alſo who he was: and having ſtayed there three moneths with great contentment, he returned to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> with a fair and grateful account to the Duke of his employment.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> dying, no ſooner was King <hi>James</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Engliſh Government, but he advances him (being returned from <hi>Florence</hi>) to the Order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and having had experience of his Abilities, ſends him Ambaſſadour to the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt twenty years; during which time he ſtudied the diſpoſitions of thoſe Dukes, and the Conſultors of State, well knowing that he who negotiates a continued buſineſs, and neglects the ſtudy of diſpoſitions, uſually fails in his propoſed ends. And although through ſome miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he fell one time into King <hi>Jame</hi>'s diſpleaſure, yet did he by an Apology ſo clear himſelf, that as broken bones
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:116025:179"/>well ſet become the ſtronger, ſo Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> did not onely recover, but was much more confirmed in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties eſtimation and favour then formerly he had been.</p>
               <p>Thrice was he ſent Ambaſſador to the Republick of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> once to the Emperour <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the ſecond, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſeveral German Princes, to incline them to equitable conditions for the reſtauration of the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and her deſcendents, to there patrimonial inheritance of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate.</hi> And although ſucceſs had made the Emperour inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, that his Embaſſage obtained not the wiſhed effect; yet ſo nobly deported he himſelf in that journey, that the Emperour adjudged him a perſon of much honour and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and at his departure preſented him with a Jewel of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, of more value then a thouſand pounds, which Sir <hi>Henry</hi> acepted; but the next morning at his departing from <hi>Vienna,</hi> at his taking leave of the Counteſs of <hi>Sabrina</hi> where he lodged, thanking her for her honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, he prevailed with her to accept of that Jewel as a teſtimony of his gratitude: with which action the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour being diſpleaſed, Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> was heard to ſay, <hi>That though he received it with thankfulneſs; yet, he found in himſelf an indiſpoſition to retain it, it being a gift that came from an enemy to his Royal Miſtreſs: he ſo uſually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Queen of</hi> Bohemia.</p>
               <p>Here it would not be amiſs for the Readers diverſion, to diſcourſe touching the Affairs of the Embaſſy of an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador: to give ſome ſhort hints, as to their Original, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, Wiſdom, Valour, quick Wits, and Behaviours; they are the Legates, Deputies, Meſſengers of Princes, and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Kings; for all theſe terms do include one function, exerciſed in different manners. And becauſe there are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſorts of them ſomewhat different from the cuſtom of our age, I will not onely treat of them as they were in times paſt amongſt the Romans, as they were in the times of their moſt magnificent glories, but as near as I can, briefly digeſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:116025:179"/>the uſage and duty of them as they are now put in office by Emperours, Kings, and Princes. The Jews were a people moſt ancient, from whom all Government, Learning, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Philoſophy and other notable things have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. Amongſt them, in honour to the antiquity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>Phineas</hi> the Prieſt, the Son of <hi>Eleazer</hi> with ten Princes of the Tribes, was ſent Ambaſſador to the Iſraelites beyond <hi>Jordon.</hi> The Greeks ſent <hi>

There might be infinite inſtances of other Nations. The perſon that ſhould be thus employed ought to be nobly born free, of good credit, honeſt, loyal, valiant, circumſpect, learned, eloquent, adorned with the languages, liberal, with other neceſſary vertues and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. For the order how Ambaſſadors have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and uſed by Princes. <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, <hi>Alex ab Alex.

Chap. ſpeaking of the time when they ſhould be received, <hi>neque illud praetereundum, &amp;c.</hi> Neither is it to be over paſſed; that it is remembred, that to Legates and Forreign Nations admitted into the Senate, the Roman Conſuls were not accuſtomed to give any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers but onely in Latin: who being admitted after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Fathers, the Senate gave them power of that they would have: but the Greeks by their Deputies appointed, did declare their mindes if any body required any thing. And the <hi>Arrebates</hi> and <hi>Belonaces</hi> did aſſemble their Councels by the ſound of Trumpets; but if they would ſpeak any thing in their own Language to ſuch being admitted, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:116025:180"/>were interpreters given, by whom they did propound what was needful, and receive the agreement and anſwers of the Senate. Many have been the priviledges, immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and advantages they have derived to their own honour and the happineſs of thoſe that have employed them. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Dandalus</hi> the Venetian Orator, being ſent Ambaſſador into <hi>France</hi> to pacifie the French King, and the great Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man, for that he was diſpleaſed with the States of <hi>Venice</hi> for the receiving of <hi>Feraria;</hi> when he had divers times uſed his beſt arguments, yet could not remove the anger of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> falling on his hands and knees (no compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but a free way of introducing the ſubtilty of his deſign) being raiſed by the Pope, he powred forth ſuch a flood of Rhetorick, that he ſo wrought on him, that he reconciled him and the Venetians. When <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, the Emperour, had met at <hi>Bononia</hi> about divers affairs, <hi>Francis Alvarez</hi> the Legate of <hi>Denide,</hi> commonly called <hi>Preſto John,</hi> was King of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſine Ethyopians, which do poſſeſs the middle part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> being come to <hi>Benonia,</hi> by the conduct of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> did in the Senate, in the name of the King, promiſe Faith and Obedience to <hi>Clement</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the year of our Lord 1533. For which wiſe diſpatch of his Embaſſy, after ages took notice of him. I ſhall forbear to inlarge my ſelf, and onely inſert a few of their Apothegms. <hi>Policartidas</hi> an Orator, being ſent with others to certain Dukes, when it was demanded of them whether his coming was publick or private, they anſwered, that if they had obtained the effect of their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, they came publickly; if not, privately: which ſubtil anſwer did admirably manifeſt their good intentions to their Countrey: for if the legation ſucceeded to their mindes, they would give the glory to their Countrey; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they would have the reproach and repulſe to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Common-wealth. The Lacedemonians ſending
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:116025:180"/>but one Legate to King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he highly reſented it for an indignity, asking if one man were enough to come to him. To which the Ambaſſador anſwered, Yes Sir, we deemed it ſufficient to ſend but one to one man. Such another anſwer did <hi>Agis</hi> the Son of <hi>Archidamus</hi> uſe, being ſent to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon.</hi> When certain Lacons, a people of Greece inhabiting <hi>Sparta,</hi> went Ambaſſador to the tyrant <hi>Ligdanus,</hi> who often deferred conference with them, excuſing himſelf that he was ſomewhat ſickly; they deſired the meſſengers to return him this anſwer, That they came to talk, not to wreſtle with the King. The Romans diſpatcht their Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to <hi>Bithnia</hi> to aſſwage a domeſtical breach betwixt <hi>Druſus</hi> the Father, and <hi>Nicomodes</hi> the Son; which Legates were ſuch as one of them had many ſcars of wounds in his head and face, another was diſeaſed in his feet, and the third but of a ſlender Wit: of whom M. <hi>Cato</hi> was wont to jeaſt, that the ſame Embaſſie lacked both head, feet and heart. Two Legates, ſaith <hi>Poggius,</hi> being ſent from the Councel of <hi>Conſtance</hi> to <hi>Petrus de Luna</hi> the falſe Pope, did amongſt other bitter chidings and hard ſpeeches which they uſed together upon the Title of the <hi>Pontificiality,</hi> after that the Pope had ſaid of himſelf, This is the ark of <hi>Noah;</hi> meaning that all the power of the Pontifical Sea remained in him: they anſwered, there were many beaſts in the Ark of <hi>Noah;</hi> expreſſing thereby, that there were many vices in the Pope, and many wicked men in the Church. Theſe with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite more might be collected out of our Engliſh Authors, but to knit up this diſcourſe wherein I have epitomized the office, management, gravity, magnanimity, policy, witty and wiſe anſwers of Ambaſſadors; to conclude, theſe meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of Princes to Princes, had, as we may allude, their firſt inſtitution and original from the order of Archangels, who have been the Ambaſſadors of God, to ſuch perſons as God hath honoured in great matters either of revelation or ſucceſſes of kingdoms; as <hi>Gabrel</hi> was to <hi>Daniel:</hi> or of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:116025:181"/>ſome ſtrange things, as he was alſo to the Virgin of the conception of the Saviour of ſouls. But enough of, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance too much to ſome cavelling heads, that there hath been ſo large a digreſſion, which I have onely enterpriſed to illuſtrate the perfection of our Knight in this illuſtrious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; he having obſerved all the laws of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and ſo mannaged the Affairs of his Prince, that he was the wonder of thoſe times he lived in, and an admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for ours.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> returning home in the latter year of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, his eſtate much waſted with his continued Embaſſies, very deſirous to enjoy the quiet of a retired life; he obtained to be made Provoſt of <hi>Eaton Colledge,</hi> which how well it ſuited to his fancy, this ſpeech of his to a friend will ſufficiently teſtifie. <hi>I thank God and the King, by whoſe goodneſs I am now in this condition; a condition which that Emperour</hi> Charles <hi>the Fifth ſeem'd to approve: who after ſo many remarkable victories, when his glory was great in the eyes of all men, freely gave his Crown, and the Cares that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, to</hi> Philip <hi>his Son, making a holy retreat to a Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtral life; where he might by devout meditations conſult with God (which the rich or buſie men ſeldome do) and have leiſure both to examine the errours of his life paſt, and prepare for that great day, wherein all fleſh muſt give an account of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And after a kinde of tempeſtuous life, I now have the like advantage from him,</hi> that makes the out-goings of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to praiſe him, <hi>even from my God whom I daily magnifie for this particular mercy, of an exemption from buſineſs, a quiet minde, and a ſufficient maintenance, even in this part of my life, when my age and infirmities ſeem to ſound me a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the pleaſures of this world, and invite me to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; in which I have ever taken the greateſt felicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This contemplative life he continued to his end, ſo that this place ſeemed to be the beginning of his happineſs, the Colledge being to his minde, as a quiet Harbour to a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring-man
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:116025:181"/>after a tempeſtuous Voyage; where by the bounty of the pious Founder, his very food and raiment were plentifully provided in kinde; where he was freed from corroding cares, and ſeated on ſuch a rock, as the waves of want could not probably ſhake; where he might ſit in a calm, and looking down, behold the buſie multitude turmoiled and toſſed in a tempeſtuous ſea of dangers!

               </p>
               <p>To another, whoſe earneſt zeal exceeded his knowledge, and was ſtill railing againſt the Papiſts, he gave this advice: <hi>Pray Sir forbear till you have ſtudied the Points better; for the wiſe Italian hath this Proverb, He that underſtands amiſs concludes worſe. And take heed of entertaining this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the further you go from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>the nearer you are to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He left behinde him many Monuments of his Learning, whoſe worth are ſuch, that they ſpeak themſelves more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably to poſterity, then any Eulogies I can beſtow upon them.

Queſtionleſs if Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> was reduced to any of theſe ſubſerviences, they were occaſioned from his generous expences in the time of his Embaſſies for his Maſters honour, who uſed him as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> who had but from hand to mouth.</p>

A great ſtickler at the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prerogative, until allured by Court-preferment he turned Royaliſt: for the King finding his worth and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity never left till he had gained him to himſelf, obliging him to his ſide by many titles of honour and places of truſt; whoſe ſervices he found equivalent to his favours, continuing to his death a truſty ſervant, a faithful friend, a
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:116025:183"/>prudent Counſellour, and a conſtant adherer to his ſide in all his exigencies.</p>
               <p>The greateſt ſervices he did to the King were during the time he was Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by his augmenting and advancing the Kings Revenues there, reſtoring the Churches maintenance, ſuppreſſing the Out-laws, eſtabliſhing obedience to Royal Authority, impediting the Tyranny and uſurpation of the great ones over the Commons, cauſing the Iriſh to leave off many of their barbarous cuſtoms, and conform themſelves to the more civil manners of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, which drew much hatred upon himſelf; for changes (though for the better) are moſt times ill reſented by the vulgar: witneſs thoſe troubles in <hi>England</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth. Nor could theſe innovations have found more diſlike in any Nation under the Heavens then <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo wedded are thoſe people to their ancient, vain, ridiculous cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>But ſince I have inſerted his moſt remarkable actions in the Life of King <hi>Charles,</hi> I ſhall omit thoſe paſſages, and come to his ſolemn Trial, ſo paramount in the Equipage of all Cirumſtances, that (as former ages have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) ſo future are unlikely to produce a parallell of them.</p>
               <p>This great Miniſter of State was by the Parliament (well known for the length of it) accuſed with twenty eight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of High Treaſon, <hi>February</hi> 16. 1640. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are too long for me here to recite; the ſubſtance of them being, that he endeavoured to ſubvert the Fundamental Laws and Governments of the Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and enriching himſelf by indirect wayes in his office, for incenſing the King againſt the Scots, for endeavouring to ſet things amiſſe betwixt his Majeſty and the people, and to have given counſel tending to the diſquiet of the three Kingdoms. The 13. of <hi>April</hi> following began his Trial in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> where there was a Throne erected for
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:116025:183"/>the King, on each ſide whereof a Cabinet incloſed about with boards, and before with a Tarras: before that were the Seats for the Lords of the upper Houſe, and ſacks of wool for the Judges: before them ten ſtages of ſeats, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending further then the midſt of the Hall, for the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Houſe of Commons: at the end of all was a desk cloſed about, and ſet apart for the Lord Lieutenant and his Councel. The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was Lord High Steward; his Accuſers were <hi>Pym, Glin, Mainard, Whitlock, St. Johns, Palmers, Sir Walter Earls, Stroud, Selden, Hampden</hi> and others; Many dayes were ſpent, and much Rhetorick uſed on both ſides: for the Lieutenant was no childe, but as cunning in the art of defence as any man in <hi>England;</hi> equal, if not ſurpaſſing his Predeceſſour the Earl of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. But the Houſe of Commons were implacable in their hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, nothing being ſatisfactory to them but his downfal: So that ſome conclude his death was for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and rather for the ſatisfaction of rancourous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, then for any guiltineſs in the cauſe.</p>
               <p>The lower Houſe perceiving by the Lieutenants inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and witty defences, a great encreaſe of his friends in the Lords Houſe, they reſolved of no more hearing of him in publique, but to draw up a Bill of Attainder, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame to the Lords, whereby firſt the matter of Fact ſhould be declared to have been ſufficiently proved, and then in the matter of Law, that he had incurred the cenſure of Treaſon, for intending to ſubvert the Fundamentall Laws of the Kingdom. And they were confident the Lords would ratifie, and approve of this Bill of theirs, and give judgement accordingly.</p>
               <p>But the Lords fearing ſuch Proceedings, as a beaten path troden out to the ruine of their own lives and eſtates, told the Houſe of Commons, that they themſelves as compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges, would by themſelves onely give ſentence in the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:116025:184"/>Cauſe; nor was there courſe ſuitable to the practiſe and State of the Kingdom, the ſafety of the Nobility, or to Equity or common Juſtice.</p>
               <p>It was replied by them of the Lower Houſe, that they were reſolved to go on with their Bill, and if the ſame ſhould be rejected by the Lords, they feared a rupture and diviſion might follow, to the utter ruine and deſolation of the whole Kingdom. That no content would be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Subject, unleſs the man who had ſo much intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon their right, and diſcontented the people, might be puniſhed as a Traytour, and dealt withal according to his demerits.</p>
               <p>But the Lords were reſolute in their firſt determinations, and reſolved to give him a fair hearing in the matter of Law, whereupon his Councel were called to the Bar, Maſter <hi>Lane</hi> the Princes Attorney, Maſter <hi>Gardiner</hi> Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Maſter <hi>Loe,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> who ſpake both much, and to the purpoſe. Yet would this nothing ſatisfie the Houſe of Commons; no, though the King in perſon in a ſet Speech declared unto them, <hi>That there never was ſuch a project, nor had the Lord</hi> Strafford <hi>ever offered ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for the tranſporting of an Iriſh Army into</hi> England, <hi>neither had adviſed him to eſtabliſh an Arbitrary Government, that he would never in heart nor hand concur with them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him as a Traytour; and deſir'd therefore that they would think of ſome other way how the buſineſs might be compoſed. Nor ſhould it ever be leſs dear to him (though with the loſs of his deareſt blood) to protect the innocent then to puniſh the guilty.</hi> But this made the Houſe of Commons a great deal the more preſſing, fearing by the Kings peremptory anſwer that there was ſome plot underhand.</p>
               <p>But the Houſe of Commons were not ſo much inflamed by the Kings Speech as the common people, who to the number of five or ſix thouſand, having Weapons and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons in their hands came to <hi>VVeſtminſter;</hi> and at the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:116025:184"/>at every Coach, cryed out for ſpeedy juſtice and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with a wonderful and ſtrange noiſe. After this they drew up the names of thoſe either in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or the Houſe of Lords, whom they imagined to favour the Lieutenant, and gave them the Title of Straffor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, with this cloſe, <hi>That all thoſe, and all other enemies to the Common-wealth ſhould periſh with him;</hi> and did poſt up the names of fifty five at the Corner of Sir <hi>William Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards</hi> houſe, in the old Pallace-yard in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> writing underneath</p>
               <q>This and more ſhall be done to the Enemies of Juſtice afore-written.</q>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons in the mean time were not idle, but brought forth a Proteſtation, or band of Aſſociation, (as they termed it) much like the Covenant taken not long before in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which without further proceſs or delay, was ſubſcribed by the whole Houſe, except the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> and an Uncle, or Friend of his.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Bill againſt the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> paſt the Lords, there were forty five preſent; of which nineteen voyced for him, and twenty ſix againſt him: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his friends abſented themſelves upon pretence, (whether true or ſuppoſitious) that they feared the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; otherwiſe his ſuffrages had more then counterpoiſed the voters for his death.</p>
               <p>Nothing wanted now, but the Kings aſſent to this Bill, which the ſame afternoon was deſired of him; the King deſired reſpite for two dayes, conſulting in the mean time with ſome Biſhops and Judges what to do in this caſe, who as the ſequel ſhows, adviſed him thereunto: ſo that we may herein admire at the wonderful Providence of God, to ſuffer not onely the King and the Country, but the Church too, to be involved in his blood, who had ſtood ſo ſtiffly in the Churches maintenance.</p>
               <p>But nothing gained his Majeſties aſſent thereunto ſo
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:116025:185"/>much, as a Letter from the Lieutenant himſelf; wherein he deſired his Majeſty that for the preventing of ſuch miſchiefs as might happen by his refuſal to paſs the Bill: intimating his conſent therein, as this following Letter of his teſtifies.</p>

                     <p>Nay, it is moſt mightily miſtaken, for unto your Majeſty it is well known, my poor, and humble adviſes concluded ſtill in this, That your Majeſty and your people could never be happy, till there were a right underſtanding betwixt you and them: no other means to effect, and ſettle this happineſs, but by the Councel, and aſſent of the Parliament, or to prevent the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evils upon this State, but by intirely putting your ſelf in the laſt reſort, upon the loyalty, and good affections of your Engliſh Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſuch is my misfortune, this truth findeth little credit, the contrary ſeemeth generally to be believed, and my ſelf repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as ſomething of ſeparation between you, and your people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a heavier cenſure then which I am perſwaded no Gentleman can ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>Now, I underſtand the mindes of men are more incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; notwithſtanding your Majeſty hath declared, that in your Princely opinion, I am not guilty of treaſon, nor are you ſatisfied in your conſcience to paſs the Bill.</p>

Here are before me the things moſt valued, moſt feared by mortal man, <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To ſay Sir, that there hath not been a ſtrife in me, were to make me leſs man, then God knoweth mine infirmities give me. And to call a deſtruction upon my ſelf and young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren where the intentions of my heart (at leaſt have been inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of this great offence) may be believed, will finde no eaſie content from fleſh and blood.</p>
                     <p>But with much ſadneſs I am come to a reſolution of that which I take to be beſt becoming me, to look upon that which is moſt principal in it ſelf, which doubtleſs is the proſperity of your ſacred Perſon, and the Commonwealth, infinitely before any private mans intereſt.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in few words, as I put my ſelf wholly upon the Honour and Juſtice of my Peers ſo clearly, as to beſeech your Majeſty might pleaſe to have ſpared that Declaration of yours on Saturday laſt, and intirely to have left me to their Lordſhips; ſo now, to ſet your Majeſties conſcience at liberty, I do moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty, in prevention of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes which may happen, by your refuſal to paſs this Bill: And by this means remove (praiſed be God) I cannot ſay, this accurſed (but I confeſs) this unfortunate thing forth of the way, towards that bleſſed agreement, which God I truſt ſhall ever eſtabliſh between you and your Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Sir, my conſent ſhall more acquit you herein to God, then all the world can do beſides. To a willing man there is no injury done. And as by Gods grace I forgive all the world with a calmneſs and meekneſs of infinite contentment to my diſlodging ſoul; ſo Sir, to you can I give the life of this world, with all the chearfulneſs imaginable; in the juſt acknowledgement of

               <p>My Lords, I am come hither to ſubmit to that judgement which hath paſſed againſt me; I do it with a very quiet and contented minde; I thank God, I do freely forgive all the world: a forgiveneſs that is not ſpoken from the teeth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (as they ſay) but from the very heart. I ſpeak it in the preſence of Almighty God, before whom I ſtand, that there is not a diſpleaſing thought ariſing in me towards any man living. I thank God I can ſay it, and truly too, my conſcience bearing me witneſs, that in all my employment, ſince I had the honour to ſerve his Majeſty, I never had any thing in the purpoſe of my heart, but what tended to the joynt and individual proſperity of the King and People; although it hath been my ill fortune to be miſconſtrued.</p>
               <p>I am not the firſt that hath ſuffered in this kinde, it is the common portion of us all, while we are in this life to erre, righteous judgement we muſt wait for in another place; for here we are very ſubject to be misjudged one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. There is one thing that I deſire to free my ſelf of, and I am very confident (ſpeaking it now with ſo much chearfulneſs) that I ſhall obtain your Chriſtian Charity in the belief of it. I was ſo far from being againſt Parliaments, that I did alwayes think the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> were the moſt happy Conſtitutions that any Kingdom or Nation lived under, and the beſt means under God to make the King and People happy.</p>
               <p>For my death I here acquit all the world, and beſeech the God of heaven heartily to forgive them that contrived it,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:116025:188"/>though in the intentions and purpoſes of my heart I am not guilty of what I die for. And my Lord Primate it is a great comfort for me, that his Majeſty conceives me not meriting ſo ſevere and heavy a puniſhment as is the utmoſt execution of this ſentence: I do infinitely rejoyce in this mercy of his, and I beſeech God return it into his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that he may finde mercy when he ſtands in need of it.</p>
               <p>I wiſh this Kingdom all the proſperity and happineſs in the world, I did it living, and now dying it is my wiſh; I do moſt humbly recommend this to every one that hears me, and deſire they would lay their hands upon their hearts, and conſider ſeriouſly, whether the beginning of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and Reformation of a Kingdom ſhould be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Letters of blood; conſider this when you are at your homes, and let me be never ſo unhappy, as that the leaſt drop of my blood ſhould riſe up in judgement againſt any one of you; but I fear you are in a wrong way.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I have but one word more, and with that I ſhall end. I profeſs that I dye a true and obedient ſon to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> wherein I was born, and in which I was bred; peace and proſperity be ever to it.</p>
               <p>It hath been objected, (if it were an objection worth the anſwering) that I have been inclined to Popery; but I ſay truly from my heart, that from the time that I was one and twenty years of age, to this preſent, going now upon forty nine, I never had in my heart to doubt of this Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor ever had any man the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuggeſt any ſuch thing to me, to the beſt of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; and ſo being reconciled by the merits of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt my Saviour, into whoſe boſom I hope I ſhall ſhortly be gathered, to thoſe eternal happineſſes which ſhall never have end. I deſire heartily the forgiveneſſe of every man, for any raſh or unadviſed words, or any thing done amiſs; and ſo my Lords and Gentlemen farewel. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:116025:189"/>all the things of this world.</p>
               <p>I deſire that you would be ſilent, and joyn with me in prayer, and I truſt in God we ſhall all meet and live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in Heaven, there to receive the accompliſhment of all happineſs, where every tear ſhall be wiped away from our eyes, and every ſad thought from our hearts. And ſo God bleſs this Kingdom, and Jeſus have mercy on my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Having ended his Speech, he addreſt himſelf to prayer, wherein he continued about a quarter of an hour; and then ſtanding up, took his leave of all the Nobles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Perſons on the Scaffold; which done, he prayed again, and then laying his head down on the Block, had the ſame diſſevered from his body by the Executioner at one blow.</p>
               <p>His Body was afterwards embalmed, and carried into <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> there to be buried amongſt his Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe the Scene, and ſhut up all with Mr. <hi>Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> excellent Epitaph on this Heroe.</p>

               <head>The Life of VVILLIAM LAUD Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis reverend Father in God <hi>William Laud</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the times he lived in neither knowing his worth nor worthy of his perſon, have too much vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He was of no extraordinary Extraction as well as Stature, yet he roſe by his deſerts to the higheſt degree of Honour. He was born at <hi>Reading</hi> in <hi>Barkshire,</hi> the year of our Redemption 1573. His Father a man of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Eſtate, willing to ſee his pregnant ſon well educated, who in few years attained to ſuch learning, that he was ſent to St, <hi>John Baptiſts Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> where he was ſuch a Proficient, that in twelve years ſpace he was looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and applauded even to admiration of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, from whence he proceeded Batchelour and Maſter of Arts.</p>
               <p>Not long after he was choſen Procter of the Univerſity, about which time he alſo became Chaplain to the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> where firſt he fell acquainted with the Nobility, a great cauſe (no doubt) of his preferment. Soon after he proceeded Batchelour, then Doctour in Divinity; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Chaplain to Doctour <hi>Neal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was by him recommended to King <hi>James,</hi> and made his Chaplain.</p>
               <p>Being now in the path to promotion, he neglected no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity conducible thereunto, but proves very ſerviceable to all thoſe who might be any wayes advantageous to his advancement; more eſpecially was he obſervient to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the grant Favorite of the times. So that in ſhort ſpace he was made Prebend of <hi>Bugden,</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Dean of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:116025:190"/>and Preſident of Saint <hi>Johns Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> beſides theſe, ſeveral Benefices beſtowed upon him, <hi>Stanford</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire, Weſt-Tilbury</hi> in <hi>Eſſex, Cuckston</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>Ibſtock</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after King <hi>James</hi> (the beſt Maſter to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that ever was) beſtowed the Biſhoprick of St. <hi>Davids</hi> upon him, and with it in Commendam the Parſonage of <hi>Creek.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> dying, his Son our late Sovereign <hi>Charles</hi> finding his abilities, took him into more ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, making him firſt Biſhop of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> then Dean of his Chappel, next a Privy Councellour, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> then Chancellour of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and not long after Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Higher he could not be advanced in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> he might, who to gain him to their ſide, made him a ridiculous tender of a Cardinals Cap; to which he returned anſwer, <hi>That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dwelt within which would not ſuffer that, till</hi> Rome <hi>were otherwiſe then it is.</hi> Implying thereby, that that Church had errours to which his conſcience could no wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>Far different was Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> from his Predeceſſor D. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi> whoſe judgement for the indifferency of things Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, made the enjoyning of them by Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> be termed an innovation; many in their writings at that time inveighed bitterly againſt Epiſcopal Government, as alſo againſt the Biſhops; three of which violent opponents were, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> a Barreſter of <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> Dr. <hi>Baſtwick</hi> a Phyſician, and Maſter <hi>Burton</hi> a Divine, who were cenſured in the Star-Chamber to pay each of them five thouſand pounds to the King, to loſe their ears in the Pillory, and to be impriſoned perpetually. The firſt in <hi>Canarvan Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Wales;</hi> the ſecond in <hi>Lanceſton Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and the other in <hi>Lancaſter Caſtle;</hi> Maſter <hi>Pryn</hi> over and above, to be ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized on both cheeks with the letter S. for a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick.</p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:116025:190"/>
               <p>This ſeverity, with the obtruding of the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Book altered, on the Scots, which was by the Kings ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial command, ſo exaſperated them and the Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, that Libels were each day ſcattered about; one paſted on the Croſs in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> That the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had his hand in perſecuting the Saints, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the blood of the Martyrs. Another in the South Gate of <hi>Pauls, That the Devil had let that houſe to him.</hi> Another on the North Gate of <hi>Pauls, That the government of the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a candle in the ſnuff, going out in a ſtench.</hi> Another hanged upon the Standerd in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> wherein his Speech in the Star-Chamber was ſet in a kinde of Pillory, &amp;c. Five hundred perſons likewiſe under the name of Apprentices beſet his houſe at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending no doubt to have done to him as the unruly Rabble did to his Predeceſſour <hi>Simon Sudbury,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, who was ſacrificed to the fury of the people; for which one of the chief, named <hi>Thomas Benſteà,</hi> being taken, was hanged and quartered.</p>
               <p>Many have been the reports that this Archbiſhop was addicted to Popery, and a great friend to the Papiſts. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he who ſhall read the relation of his conference with the Jeſuite <hi>Fiſher,</hi> will finde him ſo little theirs, as he hath for ever diſabled them from being ſo much their own as they were before, it being the exacteſt Maſter-piece of Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Divinity of all extant, as Sir <hi>Edward Deering</hi> in one of his Speeches writes, that this Book of his mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jeſuite in the fifth rib. This learned Volume might have ſatisfied the people as touching his Religion, and his Diary written by himſelf of the Integrity of his Life. For he had not any intermiſſion for his pen, and beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of minde againſt the Roman Faction, whatſoever the Covenanters have interpreted to the contrary; he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continual occaſions to lift up his eyes to heaven, for the preſervation of the glory of the Church, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                     <p>As great as the ſecret is that comes herewith, yet I chuſe rather to ſend it in this ſilent covert way, and I hope ſafe, then to come thither, and bring it my ſelf. Firſt, becauſe I am no way able to make haſte enough with it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe ſhould I come at this time, and antedate the meeting September 24. there would be more jealouſie of the buſineſs, and more enquiry after it; eſpecially if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once there ſhould return again before that day, as I muſt, if this be followed as is moſt fit.</p>
                     <p>The danger it ſeems is eminent, and laid by God knows whom, but to be executed by them which are very near about you: For the great honour I have to be in danger with you, or for you, I paſs not, ſo your ſacred Perſon and the State may be ſafe. Now, may it pleaſe your Majeſty this information is either true, or there is ſome miſtake in it. (A.) If it be true, the perſons which make the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very will deſerve thanks and reward; if there ſhould be any miſtake in it, your Majeſty can loſe nothing but a little ſilence.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs (if it be true) is extream foul. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery thus by Gods Providence offered, I do hereby humbly beg it upon my knees of your Majeſty, that you will conceal (B) this buſineſs from every creature, and his
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:116025:191"/>name that ſends this to me. And I ſend his Letters to me to your Majeſty, that you may ſee his ſenſe both of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and the Secrecy. And ſuch inſtructions as you think fit to give him. I beſeech you let them be in your own hand for his warrant, without imparting them to any; and if your Majeſty leave it to his diſcretion to follow it there in the beſt way he can, that in your own hand will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and warrant enough for him: And if you pleaſe to return it herewith preſently to me, I will ſend an expreſs away with it preſently.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I have by this expreſs returned him this anſwer, (C) That I think he ſhall do well to hold on the Treaty with theſe men with all care and Secrecy, and drive on to the diſcovery ſo ſoon as the buſineſs is ripe for it, that he may aſſure himſelf and them they ſhall not want reward, if they do the ſervice. That for my part he ſhall be ſure of ſecrecy, and that I am moſt confident that your Majeſty will not impart it to any, that he have a ſpecial eye to the eighth or the ninth Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>Sir, for Gods ſake and your own ſafety, ſecrecy in this buſineſs; and I beſeech you ſend me back (D) this letter, and all that comes with it ſpeedily and ſcretly, and truſt not your own pockets with them, I ſhall not eat or ſleep in quiet till I receive them. And ſo ſoon as I have them again, and your Majeſties warrant to proceed, no diligence ſhall be wanting in me to help on this diſcovery.</p>

               <p>This Letter I have inſerted the rather, becauſe ſome men ſharp-witted only in ſpeaking evil, have reported him to be a man of little Learning, &amp;c. To wipe off ſuch aſperſions vulgarly caſt on him, that he was addicted to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh perſwaſion: to which purpoſe they nick-name his honour Superſtitious, which wiſe and moderate men name, a zeal to Gods houſe, to his perpetual honour. The North Door of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> was repaired at his own
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:116025:192"/>charges, the Workmen themſelves not knowing from whence their money came.</p>
               <p>Thus have you ſeen this Archbiſhop mounted on the top of Fortunes wheel; but what eſtate on earth is ſo permanent, that it remains unmoveable: for Honor is like a mountain which ſeems to thoſe who are at the foot of it with his towering head to touch the skies; but to thoſe that are at the top, it ſeems with its <hi>Baſis</hi> to reach the Abyſs. <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. he was by the Houſe of Commons accuſed of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Articles of High Treaſon, and for four years together continued a Priſoner in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Yet like his Maſter and King he enjoyed not ſo much as the quiet of a priſon; for oftentimes (about fourſcore ſeveral dayes) he was carried from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there arraigned in the Houſe of Lords. At laſt he was adjudged to be hang'd, drawn, and quartered; but upon his Petition to the Lords, that ſentence was changed to beheading, which was ſadly performed on <hi>Tower Hill January</hi> 10. 1644. On the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold he made a Sermon unto the people, taking his Text out of <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12. and the 2. verſe; and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his Sermon, he made a ſhort prayer; upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion whereof, the Executioner, a ſign given him, cut off his head at the firſt ſtroak.</p>

               <p>I have not enlarged my ſelf in the writing of this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers Life, like as I have done in others; I muſt apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize, as Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> in one of his Deſcriptions writes, that ſuch a Gentleman had begun, who afterwards went through the greateſt difficulties of a moſt curious Map; to build upon whoſe foundations he held it too injurious: ſo I muſt with all ſubmiſſion acknowledge, that a Gentleman
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:116025:193"/>of moſt accompliſht parts hath made a progreſs at large in this reverend Prelates Hiſtory; for me to have went about to build, when he alone had laid ſuch a firme foundation, as ſhall out-live all other Hiſtorians, I could not but count it too ambitious; and am ſo far from thinking my ſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to attend his noble purpoſes, that if I had not thought it a crime of neceſſity, though in the Epitome to place him amongſt theſe eternized Heroes; with Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> I ſhould rather have left out a whole Countrey, then in theſe few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have committed the ſin of preſumption againſt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable endeavours.</p>

               <head>The Life of ROBERT DEVEREUX Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> General of the Parliaments Forces.</head>
               <p>THis Earl was borne in <hi>London Anno Dom.</hi> 1592. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning his morning in the evening of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> His Father was that <hi>Robert Devereux</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whoſe unfortunate life we have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of; his Mother was the widdow of Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> one whoſe Pen and Sword have rendered him famous to all poſterity. His education in his youth was at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> afterwards committed to the tuition of Biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> a reverend Divine. King <hi>James</hi> reſtoring him to his Fathers Titles and Eſtate forfeited by his fathers treaſons to Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> That a perfect reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be made in all things, a Marriage was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted betwixt him and the Lady <hi>Frances Howard,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:116025:193"/>to the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> a Lady of a tranſcendent beauty: but ſhe full of fire, and the Earl of ice, upon complaint made, they were ſeparated (by a moſt juſt ſentence of nullity exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by Commiſſion under the great Seal of <hi>England</hi>) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had enjoyed the Society of one bed for three years together. Some report that indirect and unjuſtifiable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices were uſed in the ſcrutiny of her Virginity, but I averre, according to the truth of allegations and proofs, as the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Midwives declared, ſhe was an untouched Virgin: ſo did the Earl himſelf confeſs that (though he had often attempted it) he never could and believed never ſhould unty her Virgin zone: whereupon the Commiſſioners pronounced a divorce betwixt them. Some Authors write that ſhe did not much affect the Earl, being of a luſtful appetite. Some on the other ſide imputed it to his travels; others to her looſeneſs in the time of his abſence, ſuffering her body to be abuſed. Others bring Viſcount <hi>Car</hi> on the ſtage, that ſhe placed her affections on him. Others write that Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Forman</hi> were employed to bewitch the Earl, and to procure frigidity <hi>quo ad hanc;</hi> ſo much do our Hiſtorians dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their relations of this unfortunate marriage.</p>
               <p>The Earl perceiving how little he was beholding to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> is now reſolved to addreſs himſelf to the Court of <hi>Mars;</hi> and to this purpoſe he beſtows himſelf in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> which at that time was the School of Honour for the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> in their exerciſe of Arms: where having continued for certain years, and gained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown by his experience and perfection in the feates of Arms, he advanced from thence into the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> to which place went alſo the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Borlans</hi> with their Regiments; but theſe not ſeconded as they expected, and being invaded by ſo potent an Enemy as was then the Emperour, and ſeconded by ſo puiſſant a Potentate as the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> having in vain endeavoured with ſuch weak
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:116025:194"/>forces to reſiſt ſo great power, they returned into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> dying; in the beginning of his Sons Reign a deſign went on for a ſudden expedition into <hi>Cadiz</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> which was committed to the mangement of Viſcount <hi>Wim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleton</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> who putting forth to Sea, were much dammaged with a furious ſtorm: but meeting together in the height of the Southern <hi>Cape,</hi> they ſailed to <hi>Cadiz;</hi> where having taken <hi>Puntal</hi> Caſtle, and in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to fire the Ships in the Harbour; the field men in the interim being directed to Land, for their recreation and to take in freſh water, having diſcovered the Cellers plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtockt with wine, they carrowſed thereof ſo liberally, in deſpite of more ſober commands to the contrary, as put them to the hazard of a diſmal reckoning. Whereupon the Admiral finding the Souldiers thus inſufferably diſordered, fearing the Spaniard upon this advantage might make a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable butchery amongſt them, was forced to put to Sea again; and having ſtaid ſome time in expectation of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the Plate Fleet in their returning home, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence ſo reigned in their Navy, that they had ſcarce men enow to handle their Sails; which enforced them to ply home with all the ſpeed they could.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſoon after his return made a voyage into <hi>Holland,</hi> not loving to lie idle when any action of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was on foot; where he behaved himſelf with ſuch gallant reſolution, as got him high repute in the mouthes of all men.</p>
               <p>Having given theſe undeniable teſtimonies of his valour, he was ambitious to give ſome further proofs of his virility; and having been a while in <hi>England,</hi> he ſolicites the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Paulet</hi> (daughter of Sir <hi>William Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> extracted from the noble line of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>) with whom he conſumated his Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als at <hi>Netley</hi> the Earl of <hi>Hartfords</hi> houſe; by her he had a Son, who was Chriſtned <hi>Robert,</hi> after his Fathers name; he
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:116025:194"/>dyed in the year 1636. and lies buried at <hi>Drayton</hi> in the County of <hi>Warwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this Lady he did agree and cohabit, but it was but a ſhort time, becoming ſoon unhappy in his ſecond, as he was in his firſt choice; for he could as little digeſt her over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much familiarity with Mr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal,</hi> as his former Ladies with the Earl of <hi>Somerſet:</hi> upon which diſtaſte, this Earl did ever after abandon all uxorious thoughts, and for a while lived a retired life.</p>
               <p>Soon after began the long Parliament, in which ſuch Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences aroſe betwixt them and the King, that for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding thereof, each part had their recourſe to Arms. The Parliament very wiſely choſe <hi>Eſſex</hi> for their General, there being no perſon in the Kingdom ſo fit to take the people, and credit their deſigns; who having an Army raiſed, marches with them againſt the King. The King on the other ſide proclaims <hi>Eſſex</hi> and his adherents Traytors; and confident in the juſtneſs of his cauſe, gives him Battel on a place called <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> which was fought with much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in a manner with equality; for though the King kept the field, and therein had the honour of the day, yet loſt he many brave Commanders, who there dyed in the bed of Honour. Amongſt others, the Lord <hi>Aubigney,</hi> Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Vaerney,</hi> who carried the Kings Standard, Collonel <hi>Monroe</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Soon after was an overture for Peace, but whileſt it was in agitation, a ſecond Battel was fought at <hi>Brainford; Eſſex</hi> at that time was ſitting in the Parliament Houſe, but alarum'd with the noiſe of the great guns, he ſpeedeth down, his coming putting a ſtand to the Kings Forces, who then were upon point of Victory. There were ſlain on the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſide Serjeant Major <hi>Quarles,</hi> a man of eminent parts; who left behinde him one onely Daughter named <hi>Eſther:</hi> ſince married to Maſter <hi>William Holgate</hi> of <hi>Saffron Walden,</hi> a deſerving Gentleman; whoſe love to learning and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:116025:195"/>men, hath made his name famous to all poſterity. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Lilburne</hi> with ſome others were taken priſoners: the winter then drawing on apace, both Armies retired to their Winer quarters.</p>
               <p>The next Spring <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſets forth with his Army, layes Siege to <hi>Reading;</hi> to relieve which, the King, Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> advanced with a great Army; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſted at <hi>Cauſham-Bridge,</hi> the Town was ſurrendered to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Preſently after the taking of <hi>Reading,</hi> the Parliament ſide began to decline on a ſudden; a contageous ſickneſs ſeized on the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Souldiers: the Marqueſs of <hi>New Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> was grown very powerful in the North, and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> defeated in the Weſt; <hi>Briſtol</hi> being delivered up to the King: ſo that had he with his Army come up the next way to <hi>London,</hi> it was thought he would have found but little oppoſition; <hi>Gloceſter</hi> onely held out againſt him. The King unwilling to leave any Town behinde him, layes Siege thereunto; to the raiſing whereof, the Army being not in a capacity of themſelves, the Train Bands of <hi>London</hi> aſſented to this expedition, who raiſed the Siege, and not long after gave the Kings Forces Battel at <hi>Newbery;</hi> this was a long and bloody fight, nor had either of the parties much cauſe to boaſt. On the Kings ſide were ſlain the Earl of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> Collonel <hi>Morgan,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Fielding,</hi> Mr. <hi>Strode,</hi> and other eminent perſons. On the Parliament ſide was ſlain Colonel <hi>Tucker,</hi> Captain <hi>George Maſſey,</hi> Captain <hi>Hunt,</hi> and others. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> with the Trained Bands returned to <hi>London,</hi> where he had ſolemn thanks gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Parliament.</p>
               <p>And now the Winter coming on, he had the leiſure for a while to refreſh himſelf, and to make new proviſions for War againſt the enſuing Spring; which being come, he marches with his Army from <hi>London.</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:116025:195"/>at ſome diſtance marching with him, after a while he ſits down before <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the King then was; who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Siege, about midnight did take Horſe, attended with certain Troops, who carried ſome Foot mounted behinde them, and came to <hi>Witney</hi> five miles from <hi>Burford;</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo <hi>Eſſex</hi> followed him. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> who had long laid Siege to <hi>Lyme,</hi> upon his approach towards thoſe parts, he raiſes it. The ſtrong Town of <hi>Weymouth</hi> it ſurrendered unto him, yea all the Countries round about came in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and the Garriſons opened their Gates at the firſt ſound of his Trumpet. At <hi>Chard</hi> within the compaſs of twelve miles came four thouſand men unto him, proteſting to live and to dye in the cauſe of the Parliament, as their friends at <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> did before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barnſtable</hi> revolteth to him, Sir <hi>Richard Grenvile</hi> is beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and <hi>Taunton</hi> Caſtle taken by his forces; ſoon after he poſſeſſes himſelf of Mount <hi>Stanford, Plimpton, Salt-Aſh,</hi> and divers other ſmall Garriſons: from thence he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth towards <hi>Taveſtock,</hi> where he took Sir <hi>Richard Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles</hi> houſe, and in it two pieces of Canon, eight hundred Arms, a great quantity of rich Furniture, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound in Money and Plate. He marches into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> forcing his paſſage over at <hi>Newbridge,</hi> with the loſs of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty of his enemies; about <hi>Liſtethel</hi> he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Sir <hi>Richard Grenvile,</hi> whom he overthrew, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this <hi>Bodmin, Tadcaſter,</hi> and <hi>Foy</hi> ſtoop unto him. But the King who all this while was not idle underſtanding of his advance into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> reſolved to march after him, for he found that his Army did daily encreaſe. The preſence of a Prince, by a ſecret attraction, for the moſt part prevailing upon the affections of the people. <hi>Eſſex</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſends to the Parliament for Recruits, but before he could receive any ſupply, the King had ſo cooped up his Army, that his Horſe had no room for forrage: in this ſtrait he calleth a Councel of War, wherein it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:116025:196"/>that three thouſand Horſe under the command of Sir <hi>William Belfore</hi> ſhould attempt to break through the main body of the Kings forces; which accordingly was put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: neceſſity whetting their valours, ſo that with ſome loſs they got through, and came ſafely to <hi>Plymouth.</hi> But the Foot having not that ſwift means of eſcape, were forced to yield themſelves. The Earl made his eſcape by Sea, attended with the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> and taking ſhipping at <hi>Foy,</hi> landed at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> ſick both in body and minde.</p>
               <p>Thus on a ſudden was all undone, which he with much pains and hazard had been long a doing; ſo uncertain is the chance of War, that he who now rideth triumphantly in the Chariot of Victory, may ere long become the Object of his enemies mercy.</p>
               <p>Soon after followed the new moddeling of the Army, wherein all thoſe Commanders who were Members of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe of Parliament were called home; <hi>Eſſex</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſurrendered up his Commiſſion, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> being made General in his ſtead; after which time he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſate in the Houſe of Peers, until the time of his death, which was on the 14. of <hi>September,</hi> 1646. and 56. year of his age. His Funeral was ſolemnized with great ſtate; a Monument being erected for him in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey, which a mad villain moſt uncivilly defaced.</p>

               <p>I ſhall not need to ſpend much time in ſetting forth the ſtem from whence this illuſtrious Ciens ſprung; he who hath not heard of the Family of the <hi>Lucas's</hi> knows nothing of Gentility; yet had no honour accrew'd to him from his famous Progenitors, it were honour enough to him to be Brother to that nobly accompliſhed, and deſervingly honoured, the <hi>Plato</hi> of this age, the Lord <hi>Lucas;</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſingularly gifted in all ſuitable elements of worth, as alſo to Sir <hi>Gervas Lucas,</hi> a valiant Commander, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Governour of <hi>Belvoir Caſtle.</hi> For his Education, it was generous, having his youth ſufficiently ſeaſoned in principles of knowledge, both Humane and Divine, to which joyning his Manhood and Diſcipline in the Field, he had ſcarce his equal. He was a perſon accompanied with a reſolute ſpirit, of an active diſpoſition, and a ſuitable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to mannage it; ſtrict in his commands without a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percillious ſeverity, free in his rewards to perſons of deſert and quality; in his ſociety he was affable and pleaſant, in his charge ſerious and vigilant, remiſs in nothing that might any way improve or expedite his diſpatch in Martiall Affairs.</p>
               <p>But to take a brief ſurvey of his Military Exploits, I ſhall in the firſt place (omitting engagements of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence as not ſo pertinent) mount up the Hill near <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and <hi>Enborn Chaſe,</hi> the two places where that memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Battle was fought, where Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other worthy Commanders behaved themſelves as bravely as any of the moſt eminent Heroes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this unhappy War; in which Fight Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was grievouſly wounded.

               <p>His incomparable Gallantry, in the purſuit of his deſign at <hi>Tidbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to deſcend from theſe particulars to the main thing we intend, namely his Magnanimity in defending <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> beſieged by a powerful and ſucceſsful Enemy. We will in the firſt place give you a brief account of the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, and then as briefly relate the moſt memorable concernments during the Siege.</p>
               <p>When the Parliaments Army had ſo ſubdued the Kings Forces, that not one Garriſon ſtood our for him openly, and the King himſelf ſold unto them by the Scots, it was expected by the people a compoſure of differences would have enſued, and the King reeſtabliſhed on his Throne again, according as they had promiſed in many Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But contrary thereunto, they enacted to ſettle the Kingdom without him; this much diſcontented the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the people, and firſt they ſhewed their diſlike thereof by way of Petition; but that not prevailing, they reſolve force. <hi>Langhorn, Powel,</hi> and <hi>Poyer,</hi> ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:116025:197"/>in <hi>Wales;</hi> the Scots (notwithſtanding they had ſold the King not long before) yet now exclaim againſt the Engliſh for breach of Covenant, and reſolve to have the other march for <hi>England.</hi> Againſt the Welchmen was Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent, and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> deſigned to go againſt the Scots; but called back to march againſt the Kentiſh-men, who in a Body of ſix thouſand had poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> with a reſolution to ſtand it out againſt all oppoſers. But Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> falling upon them, after a ſhort but ſmart fight, the Kentiſh-men were routed, and their Army diſperſed, onely the Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> with about three thouſand men croſſed the <hi>Thames,</hi> and paſſed into <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where he found Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> with ſome other perſons of eminent honour and quality, as the Lord <hi>Capel, Loughborough,</hi> &amp;c. with a compleat body of reſolute men: who after they had ſecured the Committee at <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> ſtruck into <hi>Colcheſter;</hi> a Town inconſiderable as was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conceived both by the Enemy and adjacent parts of the Countrey, either to receive by a proviſional way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief any great force into it, or by reaſon of the indefenſive and intenible condition of the Town, to ſtand out any time upon their ſettling or planting in it. Yet ſo conſtantly, courageous, vigilant, and incredibly induſtrious were theſe loyally diſpoſed Gentlemen, as this Town, which in opinion by reaſon of her diſproviſion could not probably hold out againſt ſo powerful and formidable an Enemy the ſpace of one week, continued three moneths in a moſt reſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, and reſiſtance of a victorious Army, ſated with ſuch fulneſs of Conqueſts, and ſupplied with ſuch freſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Recruits, to bring their ſucceſſive Atchievements to a more abſolute period. At length after many ſtout endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, Sallies and Aſſayes, gallantly performed, having eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en all the Horſes, Dogs, Cats, and whatſoever, (though moſt reluctant to Nature) could afford them nouriſhment,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:116025:198"/>this unfortunate Town of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> was ſurrendered after the continuance of three moneths Siege compleatly ended; with theſe ſtrict conditions, the ſuperior officers to mercy, and the Souldiery upon quarter for life.</p>
               <p>To thoſe that ſhall demand what ſhould be the reaſon for the beſieged to hold out ſo long, by their continued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, to bring both themſelves and the reſt of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants into ſuch miſery and fearful diſtreſs; eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there appeared no hope at all of raiſing that laſting Siege, nor of the Generals remove till he had finiſhed his deſign; beſides, their pertinacy and averſion from ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conditions as in the beginning were propoſed to them, could not but highly incenſe the General, and bring them (as afterwards it did) to extreamer terms, upon intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of their neceſſitous condition, that they might either be enforc'd to periſh through Famine, or neceſſarily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the Town.</p>
               <p>To this ſad inquiry, I anſwer, that (beſides others) there were three main reaſons, which induced them to hold out ſo long as they did.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, that not onely the County wherein they were beleagured, but other Counties too, had ingaged themſelves upon their fidelity, (a ſtrong gage of aſſurance to valiant men) that they would really joyn in aſſiſtance with them: but this ſtrong engagement procured an eaſie diſpenſation, none appearing viſibly, ſave onely a ſmall party about <hi>Saffron Walden,</hi> who as they were ſoon up, were as ſoon down; being routed at <hi>Linton</hi> by a party of Horſe under Major <hi>Sparrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But far greater hopes had they from <hi>London;</hi> many of of the Royaliſts having engaged their perſons under the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> &amp;c. to ſuccour them.

               <p>But the main reaſon which induced them on to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this Siege, was their daily expectance of relief from the North; for the Scots having now ended their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with their Presbyterian Cleargy, concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency and inconveniency of this War, with 30000. men, under the leading of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> entered <hi>England.</hi> This numerous Army of Covenanters appearing ſo invincible, made the Presbyterians in <hi>England</hi> to reſt confident, and to cry out <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to the Mother <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But as an Army of Sheep having a Lion to their leader, is better then an Army of Lions with a Sheepiſh Commander; even ſo this Canopy-General, whoſe port and magnificence in his march promiſed wonders, though it proved but Majeſty in an imbroidered habit with a feaveriſh heart. At <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> he was encountred by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> with a handful of men in compariſon of his vaſt Army; the effect of which fight was, that the Scots went home by weeping croſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining they had loſt more by <hi>Hamilton,</hi> then ever they got by <hi>Leſley.</hi>

               <p>Soon after followed the ſurrender of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five hours after the ſurrender, the deaths of Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle.</hi> What motives induced the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to more ſeverity againſt them then the reſt, I know not; but certain it is, never was the meſſage of death (though the terribleſt ſummons that can come to nature) entertained by any with more magnanimity, and undaunted reſolution, then it was by them. Never did Roman with greater courage, nor Chriſtian with firmer confidence court grim death, then did this matchleſs pair of Heroes. Sir <hi>Charls Lucas</hi> was the firſt deſign'd to dye; who having retired himſelf a while for prayer, with a pious and humble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his ſoul into the hands of God, he ſtood up, remembring no doubt, that ſaying, <hi>It behoveth a General to dye ſtanding:</hi> and tearing open his Doublet, he expoſed his
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:116025:199"/>naked Breaſt, crying out, <hi>Now Rebels do your worſt:</hi> he was immediately diſpatched on the place.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George Liſle's</hi> turn was next; who beholding that ſad ſpectacle, the dead body of his deareſt friend, fell upon it and kiſſed it, as if he meant to breathe into it another ſoul: with a free but true relation of his vertues and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he often would redouble theſe words. <hi>In how ſhort a moment has a brave ſpirit expired! well, this priority was due to thee, but I ſhall not be long behinde thee, my death which is now at hand ſhall reſtore thee to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, ſtanding up, and taking five pieces of Gold out of his pocket, he gave one to his Executioners, and the other four he ſent to four friends in <hi>London;</hi> then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtanders by, he ſaid, <hi>Oh how many do I ſee here about me, whoſe lives I have ſaved in hot blood, and now muſt mine be taken away moſt barbarouſly in cold blood! ſure the like was never heard of among the Gothes and Vandals, or the verieſt Barbarians in the world in any age;</hi>—after which words, and ſome few invocations upon the name of Jeſus, he was alſo diſpatched, as he ſtood in an Heroick poſture, courting grim death with a ſpritely countenance, and a greedy expectation.</p>
               <p>I have heard it reported by divers credible perſons, that on the ground where Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> fell when he was ſhot, there hath grown no Graſs; where the print of his body was, ſtill remaining bare; notwithſtanding round the ſame, the Graſs flouriſhed with verdancy: what this ſhould ſignifie concerning his guilt or innocency, as the wayes of God are unſearchable, ſo ſhall I not determine any thing, but leaving every one to his own opinion, pleaſe my ſelf with the onely traditional relation of it.</p>

                     <p>Moſt noble Prince, Salutation and Light of the Divine Grace: Foraſmuch as Great <hi>Brittain</hi> hath alwayes been fruitful in Vertues, and in Men of great worth, having fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the one and the other world with the glory of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown; ſhe doth very often alſo draw the thoughts of the Holy Apoſtolical Chair to the conſideration of her praiſes. And indeed the Church was but then in her infancy when the King of kings did chuſe her for his Inheritance; and ſo
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:116025:200"/>affectionately, that we believe the <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out-paſſed the Banner of the Croſs. Beſides that many of her Kings inſtructed in the knowledge of the true Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, have preferred the Croſſe before the Royall Scepter, and the Diſcipline of Religion before Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs leaving examples of Piety to other Nations, and to the Ages yet to come. So that having merited the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and firſt places of bleſſedneſs in Heaven, they have obtained on Earth the triumphant Ornaments of true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And although now the State of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church is altered, we ſee nevertheleſs the Court of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> adorned and furniſhed with Moral Vertues, which might ſerve to ſupport the charity that we bear unto her; and be an ornament to the name of Chriſtianity, if withal ſhe could have for her defence and protection the Orthodox and Catholique Truth. Therefore by how much the more the Glory of your moſt Noble Father, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your glorious inclination, delights us, with ſo much more zeal we deſire, that the Gates of the Kingdom of Heaven might be opened unto you, and that you might purchaſe to your ſelf the love of the Univerſal Church. Moreover it being certain, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great of moſt bleſſed memory, hath introduced to the Engliſh people, and taught to their Kings the Law of the Goſpel, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Apoſtolical Authority: we as inferiour to him in Holineſs and Vertue, but equal in Name and Degree of Dignity, it is very reaſonable, that we following his bleſſed footſteps, ſhould endeavour the ſalvation of thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially at this time when your Deſign (moſt Noble Prince) elevates us to the hope of an extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: therefore as you have directed your journey to <hi>Spain</hi> towards the Catholique King, with deſire to ally your ſelf to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> we do much commend your Deſign, and indeed do teſtifie openly in this preſent buſineſs, that you are he that takes the principal care of our
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:116025:200"/>Prelacy. For ſeeing that you deſire to take in marriage the Daughter of <hi>Spain,</hi> from thence we may eaſily conjecture, that the ancient ſeeds of Chriſtian Piety, which have ſo happily flouriſhed in the hearts of the Kings of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> may (God proſpering them) revive again in your ſoul. And indeed it is not to be believed that the ſame man ſhould love ſuch an Alliance that hates the Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſhould take delight to oppreſs the Holy Chair. To that purpoſe we have commanded to make continually moſt humble Prayers to the Father of Lights that he would be pleaſed to put you as a fair Flower of Chriſtendom, and the onely hope of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> in poſſeſſion of that moſt noble Heritage that your Anceſtors have purchaſed for you, to defend the authority of the Sovereign High Prieſt, and to fight againſt the Monſters of Hereſie. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the dayes of old, enquire of your Fathers, and they will tell you the way that leads to Heaven, and that way the Temporal Princes have taken to attain to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom. Behold the Gates of Heaven opened, the moſt holy Kings of <hi>England,</hi> who came from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> accompanied with Angels, did come to honour and do homage to the Lord of lords, and to the Prince of the Apoſtles in the Apoſtolical Chair: their actions and their examples being as ſo many voices of God, ſpeaking and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting you to follow the courſe of the lives of thoſe to whoſe Empire you ſhall one day attain.</p>
                     <p>Is it poſſible that you can ſuffer that the Heretiques ſhould hold them for impious, and condemn thoſe that the Faith of the Church teſtifies to reign in the Heavens with Jeſus Chriſt, and have comand and authorisy over all Principalities and Empires of the Earth? Behold how they tender you the hand of this truly happy Inheritance, to conduct you ſafe and ſound to the Court of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King, and who deſire to bring you back again into the lap of the Roman Church: beſeeching with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:116025:201"/>ſighs and groans the God of all mercy for your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do ſtretch out to you the Arms of the Apoſtolical Charity to imbrace you with all Chriſtian affection, you that are her deſired Son, in ſhewing you the happy hope of the Kingdom of Heaven. And indeed you cannot give a greater conſolation to all the people of the Chriſtian Eſtates, than to put the Prince of the Apoſtles in poſſeſſion of your moſt noble Iſland, whoſe Authority hath been held ſo long in the Kingdom of <hi>Brittain</hi> for the defence of Kingdoms, and for a Divine Oracle; which will eaſily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, and that without difficulty, if you open your heart to the Lord that knocks, upon which depends all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Kingdom. It is of our great charity that we cheriſh the praiſes of the Royal name; and that which makes us deſire that you and your Royal Father might be ſtiled with the names of Deliverers and Reſtorers of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and paternal Religion of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> which we hope for, truſting in the goodneſs of God, in whoſe hands are the hearts of Kings, and who cauſeth the people of the earth to receive healing, to whom we will alwayes labour with all our power, to render you gracious and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: in the interim take notice by theſe Letters of the care of our Charity, which is none other than to procure your happineſs, and it will never grieve us to have written them, if the reading of them ſtir but the leaſt ſpark of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith, in the heart of ſo great a Prince, whom we wiſh to be filled with long continuance of joy, and flouriſhing in the glory of all vertues.</p>

                        <hi>Holineſs</hi> with great content, and with that reſpect which the piety and care, wherewith your <hi>Holineſs</hi> writes, doth require: It was an unſpeakable pleaſure to me to read the generous exploits of the Kings my Predeceſſors, in whoſe memory poſterity hath not given thoſe Praiſes and Elogies of Honour as were due to them: I do believe that your <hi>Holineſs</hi> hath ſet their example before my eyes, to the end that I might imitate them in all my Actions, for in truth they have often expoſed their Eſtates and Lives for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of the holy Chair; and the courage with which they have aſſaulted the enemies of the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, hath not been leſs than the thought and care which I have, to the end that the peace and intelligence which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been wanting in Chriſtendom might be bound with a true and ſtrong concord. For as the common enemy of the peace, watcheth alwayes to put hatred and diſſention amongſt Chriſtian Princes; ſo I believe that the glory of God requires that we ſhould endeavour to unite them; and I do not eſteem it a greater honour to be deſcended from ſo great Princes, than to imitate them in the zeal of their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. In which it helps me very much to have known the minde and will of our thrice honoured Lord and Father, and the holy intentions of his Catholique Majeſty, to give a happy concurrence to ſo laudable a deſign: for it grieves him extreamly to ſee the great evils that grow from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Chriſtian Princes, which the wiſdom of your <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> foreſaw, when it judged the marriage which you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deſign, between the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> and my ſelf, to be neceſſary to procure ſo great a good; for 'tis very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that I ſhall never be ſo extreamly affectionate to any thing in the world, as to endeavour Alliance with a Prince who hath the ſame apprehenſion of the true Religion with my ſelf: Therefore I intreat your <hi>Holineſs</hi> to believe, that I have been alwayes very far from encouraging, or to be a partizan of any Faction, againſt the Catholique, Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

But failings have been ſuch, that his Majeſty by ſo many promiſes, and ſo ſtreight an obligation of friendſhip hath not onely been diſappointed of means to obtain liberty and ſurety for the ſaid Churches, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore peace to <hi>France</hi> by the reconciliation of thoſe, whoſe breath utters nothing elſe but all manner of obedience to their King, under the liberty of their Edicts: that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe they have prevailed by the intereſt which he had in thoſe of the Religion to deceive them, and by this means not onely to untye him from them, but alſo to make him, if not odious unto them, at leaſt ſuſpected in perverting the means, which he had ordained for their good, to a quite contrary end; witneſs the Engliſh Ships deſigned for the extirpation of them of the Religion, but to the contrary expreſs promiſe which was made, that they ſhould not be uſed againſt them in the laſt Sea-fight. What then may be expected from ſo puiſſant a Prince as his Majeſty, ſo openly eluded, but a through feeling equal and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the injuries received.</p>
                     <p>But his patience hath gone beyond policy, and as long as he had hopes that he could benefit the Churches by any other means, he had no recourſe by way of Arms: ſo far that having been made an inſtrument and worker of the laſt Peace, upon conditions diſadvantageous enough, and which would not have been accepted without his Majeſties intervention, who interpoſed his credit and intereſt in the Churches to receive them, even with threatnings, to the end to ſhelter the honour of the moſt Chriſtian King; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der aſſurance of his part, not onely for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:116025:204"/>but alſo for the bettering of the ſaid condition, for which he ſtands caution to the Churches.</p>
                     <p>But what hath been the iſſue of all this but onely an abuſe of his goodneſs? And that which his Majeſty thought a ſovereign remedy for all their ſores, hath it not brought almoſt the laſt blow to the ruine of the Churches? It wanted but a little by continuing the Fort before <hi>Rochel,</hi> the demoliſhment whereof was promiſed by the violence of the Souldiers and Garriſons of the ſaid Forts and Iſles, as well upon the inhabitants of the ſaid Town as upon ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; in lieu whereas they ſhould have retired, they have been daily augmented, and other Forts built; as alſo by the ſtay of the Commiſſioners in the ſaid Town beyond the time agreed on, to the end to make broils, and by means of the diviſion which they made to ſlide amongſt the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to open the gates to the neighbouring Troops, and by other withſtandings and inſtructions of peace, I ſay a little failed, that the ſaid Town, and in it all the Churches had not drawn their laſt breath. And in the mean time, while his Majeſty hath yet continued, and not oppoſed ſo many injuries, ſo many faith-breakings, but by complaint of Treaty, until he had received certain advice, confirmed by intercepted Letters, of the great preparation the moſt Chriſtian King made to pour upon <hi>Rochel;</hi> and then what could his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> do, but to vindicate his honour by a quick arming againſt thoſe, who had made him a complice of their deceits? And to give teſtimony of his integrity and zeal which he hath alwayes had for the reeſtabliſhing of the Churches, an eſtabliſhment which ſhall be dear and precious to him above any other thing.</p>
                     <p>This is the ſole end of his arming at this time, and not any particular intereſt; yet whoſoever would doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let him conſider the circumſtance of times, and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs as they ſtand now with his Majeſty. For, who will believe that he can have any deſign upon <hi>France,</hi> or
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:116025:205"/>to have projected conqueſts here in a time ſo diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, having now for his enemy one of the moſt puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Kings of the world? and if he had ſuch a deſign, ſurely he would have ſent greater Forces, than thoſe now ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this action, whereof if the number were known, they would be Judged but Auxiliaries onely; and that their aim is no other, but for the good of the Churches, which for many important reaſons and conſiderations, he findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged before God and man to protect and ſuccour.</p>
                     <p>But if it be alleged that his Majeſty hath been moved to take up Arms for other reſpects, as the detention and ſeiſure of the Ships and Goods of his Subjects at <hi>Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> and other places of this Kingdom, to the breach and manifeſt contravention of the peace betwixt the two Crowns which in this point tend expreſly to the irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prejudice, yea, to the total ruine of Commerce; in the rupture whereof, the poor people of this Realm, being not able to vent their Merchandizes, groans not onely under the burthen of ſo many Taxes and Impoſitions, but for the very neceſſity of life it ſelf; that the apprehenſions his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath of the powerful encreaſe of the moſt Chriſtian King by Sea, hath moved him to arm for preventing the growth thereof: And laſtly, that being hopeleſs of any accomodation of things, he hath been conſtrained to put himſelf in arms. The anſwer to all this is, that whoſoever ſhall ſearch the Arreſts, Prizes, and Seiſures which have been made on both ſides, he ſhall finde his Majeſty and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have hitherto profited by this breach, and that it turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their advantage.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place he is ſo far off from being jealous of the pretended power of the <hi>French</hi> by Sea, and that he ſhould have reaſon to hinder it, that there needs no more than for him to grant, when he thinks it fit, <hi>Letters of Mart</hi> to his Subjects, and ſo theſe vain and feeble Forces at Sea might be diſſipated without the employent of any <hi>Fleet
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:116025:205"/>Royal.</hi> Finally, that there hath been a neceſſity to arm thus, becauſe there is no hope of accomodation otherwiſe, the contrary will be moſt manifeſt to him who will conſider the reſearches which have been made at ſeveral times, as well by their own Miniſters, as by the Miniſters of other Princes to his Majeſty, to treat of accommodating things at their inſtigation. It appears by all this that his Majeſty hath not been forced to arm for any particular intereſt, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for defence of the Churches, for the ſecurity and freedom whereof he ſtood reſponſible; yet there are ſome that dare amuſe the world, that his Majeſty hath a particular deſign in it, and that he uſeth Religion for a pretext to gain a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by means whereof, and by which conjunction he hopes to puſh on his purpoſes to the end at which they aym'd No, no, our Religion teacheth us otherwiſe, his Majeſties piety (wherein he gives place to no man living) will never permit him. His deſign is the eſtabliſhment of the Churches, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is their good, and his aim their contentment, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, theſe Drums beating, thoſe Enſigns diſplayed ſhall be folded up again; And all this noiſe of War ſhall be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in night and ſilence, which would never have been but for their cauſe.</p>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> might with as much verity have pronounced (as to his content) of Parliaments, not any one he ſummoned, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had any termination other then diſguſtful to him; for no ſooner was the Petition of Right granted, but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament reſolved upon a large Remonſtrance to the King, wherein they ripped up many grievances of the Kingdom, accuſing the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> his exceſſive power, and abuſe of that power, the principal cauſe of all thoſe evils and dangers: to which the King returned a ſmart anſwer, wherewith the Commons being diſpleaſed, fell down right upon another Remonſtrance againſt <hi>Tonnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi> Whereupon the King (unwilling to hear of any more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of that nature) prorogued the Parliament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>October</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>During this Seſſion, the Earl of <hi>Denbigh</hi> with fifty Sail of Ships attempted the relief of <hi>Rochel;</hi> but prevailing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, a third Fleet was prepared ready, whereof the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was to have the Command: but being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to embarque, he was ſtabbed with a knife by <hi>Felton</hi> a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſon; of which, as alſo of his unfortunate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at the Iſle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> I refer my Reader to his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Life.</p>
               <p>The Duke being dead, the charge of the Fleet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> a Gentleman of a gallant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; but before his coming, the Town was ſo blocked up by Land, and barred up by Sea, that it was almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approachable: yet many gallant attempts were made by the Earl, bringing up his Ships to the very mouth of the Bar; but being ready to enter the paſs, the winde whisked about into an oppoſite Point, which drove them danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly foul one upon another: whereupon the Rochellers hopeleſs of relief, opened their Gates, ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Kings mercy, which was granted them.

                  <hi>October</hi> the 20. being come, the Parliament was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued to <hi>January</hi> the 20. following; at which time they met, who begun where they laſt left with Tonnage and Poundage; for complaints came in thick and three-fold againſt the Cuſtomers for taking and diſtraining Merchants goods. Great ſtickling was betwixt the King and Parliament concerning this buſineſs, the King claiming it as a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive belonging to the Crown, they denying it as an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Petition of Right. After much debating and high words on both ſides, the diſſolution of the Parliament put a period to the conteſt.</p>
               <p>Not long after, by mediation of the Seignory of <hi>Venice,</hi> a Peace was concluded between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England; Spain</hi> alſo hampred with wars and want of money, made overtures of a Peace, which at laſt was concluded, and publiſhed with more then ordinary Solemnity.</p>
               <p>Theſe Wars with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> had ſo emptied the Exchequer, that the King was forced to make uſe of his Prerogative for a ſupply, which was by ſummoning all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had Eſtates of forty pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to receive the Order of Knighthood; formerly practiſed by ſeveral Kings, though now a long diſuſe had made it a novelty. Many of the Countrey Hobs, who had gotten an eſtate lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a Fine, took it firſt as a jeaſt, and thereupon made no appearance, but their purſes afterwards paid for it in good earneſt. This project alone bringing in to the Exchequer no leſs then a hundred thouſand pound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 29. 1630. the Queen was delivered of a Son, who was baptized by the name of <hi>Charles,</hi> having two years before miſcarried of a ſon of the ſame name, who lived not above an hour, which occaſioned <hi>Randolphs</hi> Muſe thus to expreſs her ſelf.</p>

               <p>It was now ſeven years and better, ſince <hi>Charles</hi> was crowned King of <hi>England; Scotland</hi> (his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) had a Crown alſo to beſtow upon him; and the King adjudged it worth the going for; for though (ſaith one) it conferreth no one dram of ſolid and real grandure to the Throne, yet ceremoniated as it is with ſuch formalities, it repreſenteth it ſelf a ſerious vanity. There attended him this journey, the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Arundel, Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, Southampton, Salisbury, Carlile, Holland, Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>New Caſtle;</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>London, Lord Treaſurer, Secretary Cook, Vice Chamberlain,</hi> with many other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of quality. <hi>June</hi> 18. 1633. he was crowned with great Solemnity at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and having viſited <hi>Ealk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sterling,</hi> and ſome other eminent places, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back again into <hi>England.</hi> Thus he was crowned by a Nation that afterwards ſnatcht it from his Royal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>The King at his return found his Exchequer near empty, whereupon he conſults with his Attorney <hi>Noy</hi> for a way how to ſupply it; he ſearching old Records, (being a man very ſtudious that way) findes an ancient precedent of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Tax for ſetting forth a Navy in caſe of danger; to which purpoſe a Writ was iſſued out to the ſeveaal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>England,</hi> for the raiſing of money ſufficient for the ſetting forth of forty ſeven ſhips; at which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons grumbled, as an illegal Tax, contrary unto the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right. The King for his better ſatisfaction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the opinion of the Judges, who all of them under their hands confirmed the Legality thereof; yet were not the Commons ſo ſatisfied therewith, but that ſome of them ſtood it out even unto impriſonment. Much debate was afterward about it, and the King got not ſo much money,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:116025:208"/>as ill will of the Subjects thereby. At this time the King received a Letter from <hi>Sidan</hi> King of <hi>Morocco;</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents follow.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>When theſe our Letters ſhall be ſo happy as to come to your Majeſties ſight, I wiſh the Spirit of the righteous God may ſo direct your minde, that you may joyfully embrace the Meſſage I ſend; preſenting to you the means of exalting the Majeſty of God, and your own reward amongſt men. The Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er allotted to us makes us common ſervants to our Creatour; then of thoſe people whom we govern: ſo that obſerving the duties which we owe to God, we deliver bleſſings to the world; in providing for the publick good of our State, we magnifie the Honour of God like the Celeſtial Bodies, which though they have much veneration, yet ſerve onely to the benefit of the world. It is the excellency of our Office to be Inſtruments, whereby happineſs is delivered to the Nations. Pardon me Sir, This is not to inſtruct, (for I know I ſpeak to one of a more clear and quick ſight then my ſelf) but I ſpeak this, becauſe it hath pleaſed God to give me a happy victory over ſome part of thoſe rebellious Pyrates that have ſo long moleſted the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able trade of <hi>Europe,</hi> and hath preſented further occaſion to rout out the generation of thoſe who have been ſo pernicious to the good of our Nations. I mean, ſince it hath pleaſed God to be ſo auſpicious to our beginnings in the Conqueſt of <hi>Salla,</hi> that we might joyn and proceed in hope of like ſucceſs in the War againſt <hi>Tunis, Algier,</hi> and other places, (Dens, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles for the inhumane villanies of thoſe who abhor Rule and Government.) Herein whileſt we interrupt the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of malignant ſpirits of the world, we ſhall glorifie the great God, and perform a Duty that will ſhine as glorious as the Sun and Moon, which all the earth may ſee and reverence: a
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:116025:208"/>work that ſhall aſcend as ſweet as the perfume of the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious odours in the Noſtrils of the Lord; a work grateful and happy to men; a work whoſe memory ſhall be reverenced ſo long as there ſhall be any that delight to hear the Actions of Heroick and magnanimous ſpirits, that ſhall laſt as long as there be any remaining among men, that love and honour the piety and vertue of noble mindes. This action I here willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent to you, whoſe piety and vertues equal the greatneſs of your power: that we who are ſervants to the great and mighty God, may hand in hand triumph in the glory which this action preſents unto us: Now becauſe the Iſlands which you govern have been ever famous, for the unconquered ſtrength of their ſhipping, I have ſent this my truſty Servant and Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour to know whether in your Princely wiſdom you ſhall think fit to aſſiſt me with ſuch Forces by Sea, as ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thoſe I provide by Land; which if you pleaſe to grant, I doubt not but the Lord of Hoſts will protect and aſſiſt thoſe who fight in ſo glorious a cauſe. Nor ought you to think this ſtrange, that I who much reverence the peace and accord of Nations, ſhould exhort to a War. Your great Prophet CHRIST JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S was the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> as well as the Lord and Giver of peace: which may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unto you, that he who is a Lover and Maintainer of peace, muſt alwayes appear with the terrour of the Sword, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through Seas of Blood, muſt arrive to Tranquillity. This made <hi>James</hi> your Father of glorious memory ſo happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd admongſt all Nations. It was the noble fame of your Princely vertues which reſounds to the utmoſt corners of the earth, that perſwaded me to invite you to partake of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wherein I boaſt my ſelf moſt happy. I wiſh God may heap the riches of his bleſſings on you, encreaſe your happineſs with your dayes, and hereafter perpetuate the greatneſs of your name to all Ages.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion of writing this Letter was as followeth; a rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Pyrats reſt themſelves in <hi>Salla,</hi> a Port Town of the

               <p>I have the rather inſerted this Letter, conſidering how ſeriouſly our learned Doctor <hi>Heilin</hi> in his Coſmography reflected on it, ſo as to blame Mr. <hi>Le-ſtrange</hi> for omiſſion of it; the truth is, the Letter carries ſome weight with it, and ſavours of more piety then could be expected from a Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan.

               <p>To proceed, far greater troubles aroſe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Book of Common Prayer. The King at his laſt being there, obſerving that God Almighty was very negligently, and as he thought undecently worſhipt, took the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof into his Princely care: to which end he

But the Scotch, a ſcrupulous Nation in their opinion, who (as one ſaith of them) are more affraid of the name of yielding, then reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and would ſooner offend againſt Religion, then the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of it, did publickly refuſe it. From hence proceeded Tragedies, Tumults, War, and Invaſion; for upon the firſt reading thereof, the people were ſo violent againſt it, that the Dean and Biſhop of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> hardly eſcaped with life; nor were they onely the raſcal multitude that thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, but many of the Noblemen, Barons, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; amongſt whom the chief were the Earl of <hi>Hume,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lindſey.</hi> To appeaſe theſe diſorders, the King ſent down the Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> in the quality of an high Commiſſioner, impowring him with a Commiſſion to uſe the utmoſt of his intereſt and power for the ſettling of peace: but whether (as ſome write) he dealt deceitfully, in aſpiring to the Crown himſelf, or no, I judge uncertain; but moſt certain it is, that after his coming the differences encreaſed far greater then before; and no queſtion but it had become far better for the King, had this Marqueſs been either a more cloſe friend, or an opener enemy.</p>
               <p>The King being at home in no good condition, uſed all means he could to pacifie his enemies abroad, not onely winking at many of the foul diſorders of the Scots, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo yielded unto them in their deſires for many things, which nevertheleſs allayed not their ſpirits, but rather encouraged them to proceed as they had begun. For as <hi>Cleaveland</hi> hath it.</p>

                  <hi>Hamilton</hi> being returned into <hi>England,</hi> the Scots began might and main to levy Souldiers, to impoſe Taxes, to raiſe Fortifications, to block up ſome, and ſeize others of the Kings Caſtles, and to prepare for War. The King not to be behinde hand with the Scots (it being no good policy in War to ſtrain courteſie who ſhould begin firſt) raiſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable power, to the maintenance whereof many of the Nobility contributed largely, eſpecially the Biſhops; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the preſervation of their own Hierarchy. <hi>March</hi> 27. the Army began to march, the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chief: but all the preparation both of one ſide and the other proved onely an interview of two Armies, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being acted conſiderable in the way of engagement; for after a few dayes attendance upon each other, a Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was concluded upon, diſtributed into theſe Articles.</p>

               <p>This Pacification being ſolemnly ratified on both ſides, the King well hoped a general peace would enſue, but what ever the Scots pretended, the ſequel ſhewed they intended nothing leſs; for they ſtill kept their Officers in conſtant Pay, they did not ſlight their fortification at <hi>Leith,</hi> they ſtill continued their Meetings and Conſultations, they ſtill diſquieted, moleſted, and frighted all of different incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and which was worſt of all, they diſperſed a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Libel, entituled, <hi>Some conditions of his Majeſties Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with his Subjects of</hi> Scotland, <hi>before the Engliſh Nobility, are ſet down here for remembrance.</hi> Which Book tending to the defamation of his Majeſty, and diſavowed by the Commiſſioners then preſent at the Treaty, was by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Council, burnt by the common Hangman.</p>
               <p>The King (who intended to ſtay till the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was met) ſeeing matters remain in this doubtful poſture, returned into <hi>England,</hi> leaving the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> his Commiſſioner. <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 6 the Aſſembly met at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> wherein Epiſcopacy, the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> the High Commiſſion, the Liturgy, and Book of Canons, were aboliſhed the Earl of <hi>Traquiar</hi> aſſenting thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Aſſembly being ended, the Parliament began; who
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:116025:211"/>inſtead of reforming Abuſes, fell upon new moddelling the Government, forming an Act Reciſſory, whereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Acts concerning the Judicatory of the Exchequer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Proxies,</hi> and concerning confirmation of Ward Lands, ſhould be nulled. Which being ſignified to the King, he by his Commiſſioner the Earl of <hi>Traquair,</hi> prorogued the Parliament until the 2. of <hi>June</hi> next.</p>
               <p>Theſe actings of the Scots warping altogether towards War, were much forwarded by an accident. <hi>November</hi> 19. it happened a great part of the walls of the Caſtle of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> with the Cannons mounted, fell to the ground; this being the Anniverſary night of the Kings Birth-day, was conſtrued in the Grammar of Superſtition, an ominous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the ruine of the Kings deſign. The King appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord <hi>Eſtrich,</hi> Colonel <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and the Governour of the Caſtle, to take order for the re-edification of what was lapſed; but the Scots would not ſuffer any materials to be carried in for reparation. This Indignity the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth intollerable, and thereupon reſolveth to relieve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by force: to this end a private <hi>Juncto</hi> is ſelected for the cloſe carrying on of the deſign, wherein it was agreed his Majeſty ſhould call a Parliament, to aſſemble <hi>April</hi> the 13. next. The King approved well of their Councel, but withal ſaid, <hi>My Lords, the Parliament cannot ſuddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, and the ſubſidies they grant will be ſo long in levying, as in the interim I may be ruin'd; therefore ſome ſpeedy courſe muſt be thought upon for ſupplies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords willing to forward the buſineſs, told him they would engage their own credits; and the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> giving the onſet, ſubſcribed for twenty thouſand pound; the other Lords writing after his Copy, ſubſcribed conformable to their Eſtates; the Judges alſo contributed largely, as alſo the Recuſants, who are ever ſure to undergo the laſh, yielded according to their abilities. From which Loyalty of theirs to his Majeſty, the more envious and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:116025:211"/>ſchiſmatical ſort of people gave out, that the King was in his heart a Papiſt: I have thought it my duty to inſert in Latin and in Engliſh his Majeſties Declaration to all Forreign Churches concerning his ſincerity in the true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                        <p>Whereas we are given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that many falſe rumours and ſcandalous Letters are ſpread up and down amongſt the Reformed Churches in Forreign parts, by the politick, or rather the pernicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of ſome ill-affected perſons; that we have an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to recede from that Orthodox Religion, which we were born, baptized, and bred in, and which we have firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed and practiſed through the whole courſe of our life to this moment: and that we intend to give way to the Introduction, and publick exerciſe of Popery again in our Dominions; Which conjecture or rather moſt deteſtable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, being grounded upon no imaginable foundation, hath raiſed theſe horrid Tumults, and more then barbarous Wars throughout this flouriſhing Iſland, under pretext of a kinde of Reformation, which would not prove onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, but incompatible with the Fundamental Laws and Government of this Kingdom. We deſire that the whole Chriſtian World ſhould take notice and reſt aſſured, that we never entertained in our imagination the leaſt thought to attempt ſuch a thing, or to depart a jot from that holy Religion, which when we received the Crown and Scepter of this Kingdom, we took a moſt ſolemn Sacramental Oath to profeſs and protect. Nor doth our moſt conſtant practice and daily viſible preſence in the exerciſe of this ſole Religion, with ſo many Aſſeverations in the head of our Armies, and the publick Atteſtation of our Barons, with the circumſpection uſed in the education of our Royal Off-ſpring, beſides divers other undeniable Arguments onely demonſtrate this; but alſo that happy

This moſt holy Religion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ordained by ſo many Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Learned Divines, confirmed by ſo many Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and ſtrengthned by ſo many Royal Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with the Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline and Liturgy thereunto appertaining; which Liturgy and Diſcipline, the moſt eminent of Proteſtant Authors, as well Germans as French, as well Danes as Swedes and Switzers, as well Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians as Bohemians do with many Elogies (and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a kinde of envy) approve and applaud in their publick writings, particularly in the Tranſactions of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort,</hi> wherein, beſides other or our Divines (who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were Prelates) one of our Biſhops aſſiſted, to whoſe Dignity all due Reverence and Precedency was given. This Religion, we ſay, which our Royal Father of bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth publickly aſſert in that this famous Confeſſion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed (as we alſo do this our Proteſtation) to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes; This moſt holy Religion, with the Hierarchy and Liturgy thereof, we ſolemnly proteſt, that by the help of Almighty God, we will endeavour to our utmoſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and laſt period of our life, to keep entire and inviolable; and will be careful according to our duty to Heaven, and the tenour of the aforeſaid moſt Sacred Oath at our Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that all our Eccleſiaſticks in their ſeveral degrees and incumbencies, ſhall preach and practiſe the ſame. Wherefore we enjoyn and command all our Miniſters of State beyond the Seas, as well Ambaſſadours as Reſidents, Agents and Meſſengers; and we deſire all the reſt of our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects that ſojourn either for curioſity or commerce

               <p>But to proceed in our Hiſtory; the King was not ſo buſie in preparing againſt the Scots, but they were as forward in providing for his reſiſtance; thoſe of the Nobility and Gentry who ſtood firm for the King they impriſoned; they invited and procured to their ſervice many Commanders from <hi>Holland,</hi> and reared works of Fortification in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces agreeable to their deſigns. In this ſtate ſtood the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of both Kingdoms, when <hi>April</hi> 13. according to pre-appointment the Parliament aſſembled, the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:116025:214"/>being led into the upper Houſe by two Noble men, to give them account of his proceedings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having there obtained the grant of four Subſidies for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ten thouſand Foot, and fifteen hundred Horſe: implicitely hinting agreeable to what Scheme <hi>England</hi> ſhould proportion their ſupplies. The King alſo to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the buſineſs, ſent a meſſage to the Lower Houſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to them the intollerable Indignities and Injuries wherewith the Scots had treated him; and withal declared to them, that if they would aſſiſt him with ſupplies ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the exigency of his ſad occaſion, he would for ever quit his claim of Ship-money; and into the bargain give them full content in all their juſt demands. This Meſſage delivered by Secretary <hi>Vane,</hi> he (whether wilfully or caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally miſtaking I leave undetermined) required twelve Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whereas it was ſaid his expreſs order was onely for ſix. This Propoſition raiſed the Houſe of Commons to ſuch animoſity, as the King adviſing with his <hi>Juncto,</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance was repreſented to him ſo deſperate, as <hi>May</hi> the fifth he ordered the Diſſolution of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>But though the Parliament were ſullen, and would not give down their milk, the Gentry and others contributed largely, eſpecially the Cleargy, who in their Convocation granted a Benevolence of four ſhillings in the pound to be aſſeſt upon all the Cleargy for ſix years together towards this Expedition. With theſe and other forementioned aids, a Royal Army was raiſed, whereof the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> was appointed <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> Lieutenant General; but both Generalls falling ſick, the charge of the Army was committed to the Lord <hi>Conway:</hi> who marching with the Army as far as <hi>Newburn</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> was encountred by the Scots, and worſted three hundred of the Engliſh being ſlain and taken.

               <p>This Petition being ſeconded by another from the Scots to the ſame effect, the King the twenty fourth day of the ſame moneth aſſembled the Lords together at <hi>York,</hi> where it was concluded, that a Parliament ſhould be ſummoned to convene <hi>November</hi> the third next enſuing; in the mean time a ceſſation of Arms was concluded between both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereupon the King and Lords poſted to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſday <hi>November</hi> the third, according to pre-appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Parliament aſſembled; no ſooner were they ſet, but Petitions came thronging in from all Counties of the Kingdom, craving redreſs of the late general exorbitancies both in Church and State; many who were in priſon were ordered to be ſet at liberty, as <hi>Pryn, Baſtwick,</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne;</hi> and many who were at liberty were ordered to be ſent to priſon, as Sir <hi>William Beecher,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Secretary <hi>Windebank;</hi> and the Lord Keeper <hi>Finch,</hi> who was forced to flye the Land; Ship-money was voted down, the late Cannons damn'd, Peace is concluded with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and three hundred thouſand pound allowed them for reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:116025:216"/>This was ſummarily the firſt actings of the Parliament, which gave much content to many people, eſpecially the Londoners; who to the number of 15000. Petition for the aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy it ſelf. Indeed ſome few of the Cleargy at this time, as at all others, were corrupt in their lives; many of them being vicious, even to ſcandal; yea, many of thoſe who pretended much purity in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations were moſt covetous and deceitful in their dealings, beſides their pride was intollerable; inſomuch, that a great one amongſt them was heard to ſay, <hi>He hoped to live to ſee the day, when a Miniſter ſhould be as good a man as any up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart Jack Gentleman in</hi> England. Well therefore might it it be ſaid of the Prieſts of our times, what <hi>Gildas</hi> ſirnamed the wiſe, wrote of the Prieſts of his time. <hi>Sacerdotes habet Britannia, ſed inſipientes; quam plurimos, Miniſtros, ſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudentes; clericos, ſed raptores ſubdeles, &amp;c.</hi> Great <hi>Brittain</hi> hath Prieſts indeed, but ſilly ones; Miniſters of Gods word very many, but impudent; a Cleargy, but given up to gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy rapine, &amp;c. Yet let none miſtake me, I write not thus to perſwade any to an ill opinion of the Miniſtry; for though our Church had cauſe to grieve for the blemiſhes of many, yet might ſhe glory in the ornaments of more; ſo that Epiſcopacy received not at this time the fatal blow, but was onely mutilated in her former glory: the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons voting, that no Biſhop ſhall have any vote in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, nor any Judicial power in the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> nor bear any ſway in Temporal Affairs, and that no Cleargy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall be in Commiſſion of the Peace.</p>
               <p>The Parliament having thus ſet bounds to the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant power of the Cleargy, they next fell upon the Tryal of the Deputy of <hi>Ireland;</hi> who as you heard not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was committed priſoner to the Tower: this man at firſt was a great ſtickler againſt the Prerogative, until allured by Court preferment he turned Royaliſt. <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> was the place aſſigned for his Tryal; the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:116025:216"/>being Lord High Steward, and the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> Lord High Conſtable; the Articles charged againſt him being very many, are too long to recite. I having more at large in their place inſerted them in his Life. The ſum of them were for ruling <hi>Ireland</hi> and the North of <hi>England</hi> in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary way, againſt the Laws, for retaining the Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue without account, for encreaſing and encouraging Popery, for maliciouſly ſtriving to ſtir up and continue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for labouring to ſubvert Parliaments, and incenſe the King againſt them; yet notwithſtanding this high charge, the Earl by his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers ſo cleared himſelf, that the King told the Lords, he was not ſatisfied in Conſcience to Condemn him of high Treaſon, but acknowledged his miſdemeanours to be very great; at laſt wearied with the clamours of the people, the Earl alſo by a letter deſiring the ſame, he granted a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to four Lords to Sign the Bill for his Execution; which Execution was accordingly performed on <hi>Tower-hill, May</hi> 10. 1641.</p>
               <p>Thus dyed this unhappy Earl, a ſacrifice to the Scots re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, cut off (as it was thought) not ſo much for what he had done, as for fear of what he afterwards might do; a man of the rareſt parts, and deepeſt judgement of any Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man of our late times.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, fatal to the King, he Signed the Bill for the Deputy of <hi>Irelands</hi> death, he alſo Signed the Bill for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enial, or perpetual Parliament, which ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved without conſent of both Houſes; ſome ſay Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> counſelled him to it, others ſay it was the Queen, whoever it was, it was his ruine: for the Parliament now fearleſs of a diſſolution began to act in an higher way then before, being fortified with a ſtrong guard of Souldiers, whereof the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was Captain: they without the Kings leave or knowledge, appoint an extraordinary Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in the City, that ſhould mannage all weighty and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:116025:217"/>great occurrences; and to weaken his Majeſty the more, or rather to ſatisfie the inſolence of the people, they caſt twelve Biſhops into Priſon, becauſe they went about to maintain their priviledge by the publick Charter. The King moved with this, accuſed five of the lower Houſe, and one of the upper Houſe of high Treaſon; their names were, the Lord Viſcount <hi>Mandevil,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Strowd.</hi> This action of the Kings was by the Parliament adjudged a great breach of their Priviledges; certainly it much encreaſed the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between them, and left ſcarce any poſſibility of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement.</p>
               <p>This ſmall river of Diſcord being now grown a Sea of Diſſention, the King and Queen poſte to <hi>Hampton Court;</hi> yet before he went, that he might clearly demonſtrate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intentions to compoſe all differences, he conſented to the Petition of the Parliament, to exclude the Biſhops out of the Houſe; an act very prejudicial to himſelf; for by this means, the ſcale of Votes in the upper Houſe which oft had turned to his advantage, did by this diminution encline moſt commonly the other way.</p>
               <p>Having ſtaid about a moneth at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> the Queen went into <hi>Holland,</hi> to accompany her Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> who was lately married to the young Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> The King, the Prince, the Palſgrave, the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and ſome other of the Nobility went down into the North, intending to ſeize on the Magazine at <hi>Hull;</hi> but the Parliament had before ſent down one of their own Members, Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> who from the Walls denyed his Majeſty entrance: the King complaineth hereof to the Parliament, but they juſtifie his Act; yet what grains of affection towards his Majeſty were wanting in <hi>Hull,</hi> were found ſuperabundant in the City of <hi>York;</hi> who with the Counties adjacent, declare unanimouſly for his Majeſty.

               <p>Hitherto have we beheld <hi>England</hi> like a curious Garden flouriſhing with all the choiceſt flowers both for ſcent and colour that ever <hi>Flora</hi> watred with pearly drops, or <hi>Titans</hi> radiant beams gave birth unto, whoſe flouriſhing branches adorn'd with Turtles twinn'd in chaſte embraces, as if they ſimpathized of each others peaceful and fruitful vertues, that Nature her ſelf was enamour'd to walk into the twined Meanders of her curious Mazes; here might you ſee the Princely Roſe [the King of Flowers] ſo full of fragrancy, that for its ſmell and colour it was the envy of all the world: there might you ſee the Lilly, [Queen of Flowers] there might you ſee the Olive Plants [the Royal Progeny] placed round about a table, where Kings and Queens had uſed to feaſt; [the Nobility and Gentry] emulating each other to excell in ſweetneſs. But now (alas) with our late diſcords, the Scene is ſo altered, that this curious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hath been over-run with Weeds, I mean the miſeries which followed upon theſe diſſentions. For (as one writes) the War went on with horrid rage in many places at one time; and the fire once kindled, caſt forth through every corner of the Land not onely ſparks, but devouring flames; inſomuch, as the Kindom of <hi>England</hi> was divided into more Battles then Counties; nor had ſhe more Fields then Skirmiſhes, nor Cities then Sieges, almoſt all her Palaces of Lords, and great Houſes, being turned every where into Garriſons: they fought at once by Sea and Land, and through all <hi>England</hi> (who could but lament the miſeries of his Countrey) ſad ſpectacles were of plundering and firing Villages; and the Fields, otherwiſe waſte and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, rich onely and terribly glorious in Camps and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>The Kings ſide at firſt proſpered exceedingly, the Earl of <hi>New Caſtle</hi> his General in the North, overthrowing the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and driving him into <hi>Hull:</hi> in the Weſt Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> a Parliament Chieftain, was utterly defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:116025:218"/>by the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> who came from <hi>Oxford</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Kings; and having loſt all his Army, made haſte to <hi>London:</hi> and ſuch as the fortune of the Field was, was the condition of Towns and Garriſons; for immediately after <hi>Wallers</hi> defeat, the two greateſt Cities of all the Weſt were yielded up, <hi>Briſtol</hi> to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and <hi>Exceſter</hi> to Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi> So that now the King was maſter of all the Weſt, ſave onely <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> which he beſieged with a Royal Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſſex</hi> himſelf the great General at the ſame time, his Army decreaſing ſuddenly, ſome dying of ſickneſs, others for want forſaking their Colours, was conſtrained to leave the Field, and return to <hi>London,</hi> quartering the ſick and weak remnant of his Army at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> and other adjacent places, until a recruit could be made for him; ſo that it was judged by wiſe men, if the King leaving <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> had marched directly with his victorious Army to <hi>London,</hi> which was then not at all fortified, and miſerably diſtracted with Factions within it: or beſides, if the Earl of <hi>New Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> letting alone the beſieging of <hi>Hull,</hi> (which likewiſe proved fruitleſs) had poured out his numerous Forces upon the Eaſtern aſſociated Counties, he had been more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then he was. But <hi>Fata viam invenient,</hi> Deſtiny will finde wayes that never were thought of makes way where it findes none; and that which is decreed in Heaven ſhall be effected by means, of which earth can take no notice of.</p>
               <p>The King to no purpoſe thus ſpending his time at <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Eſſex</hi> the whiles recruiteth his Army, with which marching from <hi>London</hi> eighty miles, he raiſeth the Siege; and having relieved the Town, in his retreat from thence encountered and vanquiſhed the Kings Army near to the Town of <hi>Newbery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both ſides, excepting onely the inexhauſtible riches and ſtrength of the City of <hi>London,</hi> by this overthrow ſeemed of equal ſtrength; yet each of them endeavours to make
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:116025:219"/>themſelves ſtronger, the Parliament calling in to their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the Scots, the King the Iriſh. The Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> was General of the Scots, to whom joyned the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and with joynt Forces beſieged <hi>York;</hi> to raiſe the Siege Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> came with a great Army out of the South, the three Generals left their Siege to fight the Prince: under him alſo <hi>New Caſtle</hi> having drawn his Forces out of <hi>York,</hi> ſerved; who on a great Plain called <hi>Marſton Moor</hi> gave Battle to the three Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. The Victory at firſt enclined to the Royaliſts, but by the valour of <hi>Cromwel</hi> (who fought under <hi>Mancheſter</hi>) their whole Army was utterly defeated, Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> his Ordnance, his Carriages, and Baggage being all taken.</p>
               <p>This was the greateſt Battel of the whole Civil War, and might have proved a great <hi>Remora</hi> to the Kings proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, had he not ſoon after worſted <hi>Eſſex</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> who having loſt all his Artillery returned to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament ſoon after new modelled their Army; Sir <hi>Thom as Fairfax</hi> was choſen General in the room of <hi>Eſſex:</hi> and now the Idol of a Treaty was ſet up at <hi>

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:116025:222"/>reformation of the Church is not the chief, much leſs the onely end of the Scotch Rebellion; but it being preſumption and not piety ſo to truſt a good cauſe as not to uſe all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to maintain it; I have thought of one means more to furniſh thee with for my aſſiſtance than hitherto thou haſt had: it is that I give thee power to promiſe in my name (to whom thou thinkeſt moſt fit) that I will take away all the Penal Laws againſt the Roman Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as God ſhall enable me to do it; ſo as by their means or by their favours, I may have ſo powerful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance as may deſerve ſo great a favour, and inable me to do it: But if thou ask what I call that aſſiſtance, I anſwer, that when thou knoweſt what may be done for it, it will be eaſily ſeen, if it deſerve to be ſo eſteemed. I need not tell thee what ſecreſie this buſineſs requires, yet this I will ſay, that this is the greateſt part of confidence I can expreſs to thee; for it is no thank to truſt thee in any thing elſe but in this, which is the onely thing of difference in opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, and yet I know thou wilt make make as good a bargain for me even in this, I truſting thee (though it concern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) as if thou wert a Proteſtant, the viſible good of my Affairs ſo much depending on it; I have ſo full entruſted this, Bearer <hi>Pooly,</hi> that I will not ſay more to thee now, but that herewith I ſend thee a new <hi>Cypher,</hi> aſſuring thee that none hath or ſhall have any Copy of it but my ſelf, to the end thou mayeſt uſe it when thou ſhalt find fit to write any thing which thou wilt judge worthy of thy pains to put in Cypher, and to be deciphered by none but me, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from him to thee, who is eternally thine.</p>

               <p>The Spring approaching, both ſides prepare themſelves for action; a great party of the Royaliſts was trouted by <hi>Cromwel</hi> at <hi>Iſlip-Bridge,</hi> divers of the Commanders taken priſoners: the remainder of the party flying to <hi>Bletchting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Houſe,</hi> were there beſieged and taken; with the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at <hi>Bampton-buſh,</hi> he took <hi>Vaughan</hi> and <hi>Littleton,</hi> and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:116025:223"/>defeated their forces. The King in the mean time marched Northward with his Army, and took the ſtrong and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Town of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after was that diſmal Battel at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> where the fate of <hi>England</hi> was to be determined; the number of both ſides were not much unequal, nor the ordering of their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia's much unlike; the Kings Front was filled with brave Troops of Horſe, the Foot ſtood in the ſecond body, the right Wing was commanded by the Princes <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> the left by Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley;</hi> other Commanders of great quality ſuſtaining their parts.</p>
               <p>The Parliamentarian Foot made a firm body in the midſt, the wings were guarded by the Horſe, the right wing was commanded by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the left wing by <hi>Ireton;</hi> the Foot (being divided into two bodies) was commanded by Major General <hi>Skippon:</hi> fortune at the firſt favoured the Royaliſts. The Parliaments left wing being routed by Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the commander <hi>Ireton</hi> wounded, and taken Priſoner; but betwixt the two other Wings the caſe was different, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> coming on with ſo great force, that he routed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Kings left Wing: the Battel ſeemed in an equal ballance, the Wings on both ſides being ſcattered, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſharp diſpute, the Royaliſts were routed, their Horſe diſſerting the Foot fled to <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> the cumberſome plunder of which place being reputed the occaſion of that defeat. The Kings Standard and one hundred other Colours were taken, all the Ordnance, the Kings Coach, Cabbinet Letters, a rich booty of Jewels, a great quantity of Gold and Silver, and almoſt five thouſand priſoners; which may ſeem the more ſtrange, ſince on both ſides there were not five hundred ſlain.</p>
               <p>To proceed, the loſs of that day loſt the King his Crown; for preſently after this, <hi>Leiceſter, Bath, Sherburn,</hi> yea, and <hi>Briſtol</hi> it ſelf were yielded up; the Town of <hi>Taunton</hi> long beſieged by <hi>Goring</hi> was relieved by General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:116025:223"/>ſoon after took <hi>Tiverton</hi> and <hi>Dartmouth;</hi> and then march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Cornwal</hi> at a place called <hi>Torrington</hi> gave the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> a great overthrow. <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the mean time took <hi>Baſin</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> the <hi>Devizes</hi> and <hi>Barcklay</hi> were taken by other Commanders, <hi>Wodſtock</hi> by <hi>Rainsborough,</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile</hi> by the Scots; who marching from thence to beſiege <hi>Newark,</hi> were called back to the relief of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then almoſt ſubdued by the Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> of whom I ſhall inſert the leſs, having particularized it in his Life. This Marqueſs at firſt ſided with the Covenanters, participated of their counſels, and was the firſt man when the Scots invaded <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1639. that ſet footing on Engliſh Ground; but afterwards deteſting their doings, he became the moſt bitter enemy to them that ever they had. About the beginning of the year 1644. when the Scottiſh Covenanters came into <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt the Parliament, <hi>Montroſs</hi> went to <hi>Oxford</hi> to the King, to offer his ſervice againſt the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The King to fit him for-that, purpoſe, created him a Marqueſs, and gave him his Commiſſion, to be Lord Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and General of all his Forces. <hi>Scotland</hi> being then wholly under the Covenanters, it was agreed that the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> ſhould by the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> ſend over into <hi>Argile</hi> (where the paſſage is ſhort into <hi>Ireland</hi>) ten thouſand Iriſh as a ſtock to begin withal; this promiſe at the appointed time <hi>Antrim</hi> performed in part, but was very deficient in the number of Souldiers; for inſtead of ten thouſand, he ſent ſcarce twelve hundred, under the conduct of <hi>Macdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald: Montroſs</hi> notwithſtanding with theſe men, and the addition of his Atholians, patcht up an Army, with which he afterwards performed ſuch exploits, as would poſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity amongſt all the Camps of their famed Heroes, to finde a parallel to this Army.</p>
               <p>The firſt Summer after his arrival in <hi>Scotland</hi> he gave the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> a great overthrow; fiteen hundred of his
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:116025:224"/>men being ſlain and taken; afterwards at a place called <hi>Kilſithe,</hi> having ſcarce 4000. Highlanders and Iriſh, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered and overthrew the States great Army, ſlew above five thouſand of them, and diſperſed the reſt: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is their Army ſent for, all <hi>Scotland</hi> being almoſt at his devotion. Sir <hi>David Leſley</hi> returned with the Horſe, and at <hi>Selkirk</hi> gave <hi>Montroſs</hi> a defeat. The King in the mean time was routed at <hi>Routen Heath</hi> by <hi>Pointz</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Parliaments Army, the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> the next moneth was beaten at <hi>Sherburn</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and afterwards utterly defeated at <hi>Carliſle, Cheſter</hi> long defended by <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was yielded up, and <hi>Aſhley</hi> himſelf the Kings General vanquiſhed by <hi>Morgan,</hi> and taken priſoner with one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred of his men.</p>
               <p>The King had now no Garriſons left but <hi>Oxford, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, Banbury, Wallingford, Worceſter, Ragland,</hi> and <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennis; Newark</hi> was ſtraitly beſieged by <hi>Leven, Pointz,</hi> and <hi>Roſſiter, Oxford</hi> (wherein the King was himſelf) began to be blocked up by <hi>Ireton</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and every day the coming of <hi>Fairfax</hi> himſelf, and a ſtraiter Siege of that City was expected; the King reſolved therefore to go out of <hi>Oxford</hi> before this ſhould happen, and communicating his mind to ſome ſecret and faithful Councellours, above all other places, he pitched upon the Scottiſh Camp: to the Scots therefore, as they lay before <hi>Newark,</hi> the King ſent <hi>Montruel</hi> the French Ambaſſadour, and himſelf ſoon after, as <hi>Aſhburnhams</hi> man, with a Cloak-bag behinde him, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped unknown out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and came to <hi>Newark,</hi> to the Scots, hoping to be received with great humanity by ſuch good Subjects as they boaſted themſelves to be.</p>
               <p>But now both Fortune and Fidelity failed the diſtreſſed King; the Scots they firſt betray him and then <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> like waſhed their hands to declare their Innocency. They delivered the King to the Engliſh upon Conditions (as they pretended) that no violence ſhould be offered to his
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:116025:224"/>Perſon; the Engliſh now having their King a Priſoner, carry him firſt to <hi>Holnbey</hi> Caſtle, then to <hi>Roiſton,</hi> thence to <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> not long after to <hi>Cauſam,</hi> then to the Earl of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> Houſe near <hi>Ouborn,</hi> ſoon after to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> the moſt ſtatelieſt of all his Palaces; but with what content to his dejected minde let others judge, to ſee his Palace turned into a Priſon, and himſelf to be a Captive, muſt needs be a ſorrow fitter for out amazement then expreſſion; for certainly as joy is moſt ſweet to them who have taſted the miſeries of ſorrow, ſo ſorrow is moſt bitter to them who have alwayes lived in bliſs, as one of our modern Poets ſings.</p>

               <p>The King had not been long in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> but he ſends a Letter of great length to the Parliament, in which he delivered his ſenſe and opinion concerning the abolition of Epiſcopacy, he diſputed out of the dictates of his conſcience much, and gave touches alſo of other matters; of all which he hoped that he ſhould ſatisfie the Parliament with his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if he might perſonally treat with them; therefore he earneſtly deſired to be admitted with honour, freedom, and ſafety, to treat perſonally at <hi>London:</hi> the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> with great vehemence alſo preſſed that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the King might be granted.</p>

               <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> would ſeem in no wiſe to give their conſent that theſe four Bills ſhould be ſent to the King, before he treated at <hi>London;</hi> therefore, in a very long Declaration they proteſted againſt it: the King like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe denyed to Sign them when they were ſent unto him.

               <p>To theſe Votes of Parliament the Army declared their conſent and approbation, and that they would live and dye in defence of the Houſe of Commons; but the people, though before they were enraged againſt the King; now ſeeing their errours, reſolved to plead his Cauſe: Petitions upon Petitions are preſented for a perſonal Treaty with the King, for the disbanding of the Army, and for the removal of all other grievances. <hi>Langhorn, Powel,</hi> and <hi>Poyer,</hi> three eminent Commanders, who had done many and great ſervices for the Parliament, now declare themſelves for the King; and with an Army of 8000. men fortifie <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Chep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow</hi> Caſtles: Sir <hi>Thomas Glemham</hi> in the North ſeizes upon <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> upon <hi>Barwick</hi> and fortified it; the ſtrong Caſtle alſo of <hi>Pomfret</hi> was then taken by the Royaliſts, and the Governour ſtain. Againſt theſe Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was marching Northwards, but far greater dangers detained him in the South, for the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh men not far from <hi>Graveſend</hi> were gotten together into an Army; with whom were above twenty Knights, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and Gentlemen of the Countrey, and amongſt them divers Commanders formerly of the Kings Armies: upon the approach of the Parliaments Army ſome two thouſand of them march to <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> which they reſolved to make good againſt the Army. <hi>Fairfax</hi> (after the diſpute of ſome paſſages) breaks up to them, and aſſaults the Town with a great deal of boldneſs; they on the other ſide defend themſelves with unſpeakable courage; at laſt the Kentiſh men are overcome, 200. being ſlain, and about 1400. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners. But the Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> with about 3500.

               <p>The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> ſoon after his riſing was put to flight by Sir <hi>Michael Leveſey</hi> and others.

                  <hi>Haſting</hi> (Brother to the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi>) were ſent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to <hi>London.</hi> The Lord <hi>Capel</hi> ſome few weeks after, together with Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> were all three beheaded.</p>
               <p>The Parliament during theſe Broils, to give ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction to the Kingdom, annulled their former votes of making no further addreſſes to the King, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again to their ſeats eleven of their Members, who had formerly been impeached by the Army: a Treaty was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be with the King in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> with two of the Houſe of Commons were ſent to the King, who made anſwer, that he was very ready to treat of peace; and named <hi>Newport</hi> in that Iſland to be the place. Five of the Houſe of Peers, and ten of the Houſe of Commons were appointed Commiſſioners, and the Treaty went on with a great deal of ſeeming ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on both ſides. But whiles they were intent upon the buſineſs, a Petition was exhibited to the Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they deſired that the King might be tried by the Laws, and brought to juſtice, and all further Treaties with him to be laid aſide; which when the Parliament denied, the Army not being ſatisfied, they march ſome of them towards <hi>Newport,</hi> others to the King, who was now a Priſoner as large.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the General ſends his Letters to Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Hammond,</hi> to render up his Command to Collonel <hi>Ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> who is to take the charge of the King; but the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vote him hereupon to ſtay there, of which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral having notice 27. <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Army faſt and pray, and receive (according to the ſtill continued faſhion) Petitions from ſeveral Counties in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to what they intend to reſolve, and therefore <hi>Hammond</hi> ſubmits and delivers up the King to <hi>Ewers,</hi> and comes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Army.</p>
               <p>The Parliament are angry, and vote a Letter to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:116025:228"/>that his orders and inſtructions for ſecuring of the Kings perſon, are contrary to their reſolutions and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to Collonel <hi>Hammond,</hi> and that it is the pleaſure of the Houſe that his Excellency recal his orders, and that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Hammond</hi> be free to take his charge to the Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> the Treaty being ended, but inſtead of obedience hereto he ſalutes them with a ſharp Letter for money to pay Arrears for the Army: hereupon the Army marches to <hi>London,</hi> and the King had his removes by <hi>Ewers</hi> till he came to the Block.</p>
               <p>After that the Houſe had paſt their Vote for no addreſs to the King, he being in a ſad condition by his ſtricter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in <hi>Hurst Caſtle,</hi> hearing of theſe Votes, prepares his ſoliloquies for his aſſured comfort in death, as we finde his meditations in thoſe golden Leaves of his Book. <hi>As I have leaſure</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſo I have cauſe more then enough to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on and prepare for my death; for I know that there are but a few ſteps betwixt the Priſons and the Graves of Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Ax was laid to the root of the Tree, the Houſe of Commons vote that by the Fundamental Laws of the Realm, it is Treaſon for the time to come to Levy War againſt the Parliament and Kingdom; the Ordinance for the Kings Trial was refuſed by the Lords, <hi>January</hi> 2. After this a Proclamation was from the Houſe of Commons for any one to accuſe the King, the Ordinance of the Trial was <hi>January</hi> 6. engroſſed and read, and the manner referred to the Commiſſioners who were to try him in the Painted Chamber, <hi>Munday</hi> the 8. of <hi>January,</hi> a Proclamation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be made in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> the Commiſſioners to ſit the next day, to which intent Mr. <hi>Denby</hi> the younger, a Serjeant at Arms to the Commiſſioners, rid into the Hall, the Drums of the Guard beating without the Palace, and in like manner at the Old <hi>Exchange,</hi> and in <hi>Cheapſide, Jan.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>The Commons Vote the Title in Writs of <hi>Caroli dei gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> &amp;c. to be altered, that great Seal be broken, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:116025:228"/>a new one, with the Arms of <hi>England,</hi> and the Harp for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with this word, <hi>The great Seal of</hi> England; and on the reverſe the Picture of the Houſe of Commons, with theſe words, <hi>In the firſt year of Freedom by Gods Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> 1648.</p>
               <p>Now there was a new Tribunal erected, there being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed 150 Judges or Tryers, that ſo in number they might repreſent the people who are improved to covenant, hear, Judge, and Execute <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> King of <hi>England;</hi> of theſe there were of ſeveral ſorts of perſons, ſix Earls of the upper Houſe, the Judges of the Kingdom, Commanders of the Army, Members of the Commons, Lawyers, men of ſeveral Trades and Profeſſions. The Presbyterian Miniſters, now too late, diſclaim againſt the proſecutions, and the Engliſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility offer themſelves pledges on the the Kings behalf, but all too late; and now the penitent Scots with their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor repent themſelves of their Silver, and in a Declaration expreſs their diſlike.</p>
               <p>The High Court of Juſtice was framed in the upper end of <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> betwixt the then Kings Bench and the Chancery. <hi>Saturday, Jan.</hi> 20. the King was brought from St. <hi>James</hi> through the Park in a Sedan to <hi>White Hall,</hi> thence by Water with guards to Sir <hi>John Cottons</hi> Houſe, at the back end of <hi>Weſtminſter Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judges met in the Painted Chamber attending the Preſident <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> in his Scarlet Robe, the Sword born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him by Collonel <hi>Humphry,</hi> the Mace by Serjeant <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> the younger, and twenty men for his guard with Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans, himſelf ſits down in a Crimſon Velvet Chair of State, fixed in the midſt of the Court with a Desk before him, and thereon a Cuſhion of Crimſon Velvet; the ſeats of each ſide, benches covered with Scarlet Cloath; the Partizans divided themſelves on each ſide. O yes! and ſilence made, the great Gate of the Hall was opened for any one to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Collonel <hi>Tomſon</hi> brought forth the Priſoner, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:116025:229"/>with his Mace received him to the Bar, where was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a red Velvet Chair; the King looks ſternly on the Court, where he ſpyes one perſon who had received ſignal favours from him; at the ſight of whom, as I received it from one in the Court, he laid his hand on his breaſt, and pronounced to himſelf ſcarce audibly, <hi>Caeſars</hi> words, <hi>Et tu Brute:</hi> after which he ſat down, not ſhewing the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Court, but preſently riſes and looks downwards on the guards and multitudes of the ſpectators. The Act of parliament for the Tryal of <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was read over by the Clerk, one <hi>Phelps,</hi> who ſat on the right ſide of the Table, covered with a Turky Carpet, placed at the feet of the Preſident, upon which lay the Sword and Mace.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral names of the Rolls of Tryers were called over, and eighty anſwered to their names, in the charge the King is accuſed in the name of the People of <hi>England</hi> of Treaſon, Tyranny, and of all the Murthers and Rapines that had happened in the War, they impoſed all the weight of the accuſation on this, that he raiſed War againſt the Parliament.</p>
               <p>A great many people looking on with groans and ſights, deploring the condition of their King.</p>
               <p>The Preſident ſtood up and ſaid,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Sir you have heard your Charge containing ſuch matters as appear by it, and in the cloſe it is prayed that you anſwer to your Charge which this Court expects.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The King whileſt he heard this Charge, with a majeſtick countenance and a ſmile in anſwer to the Preſident, asks the new judges by what Auhority they did bring to Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al a King, their moſt lawful Sovereign againſt the Publick Faith, ſo lately given him, when he commenced a Treaty with the Members of both Houſes.</p>
               <p>By what (ſaith he) emphatically lawful Authority; for (ſaith he) I am not ignorant that there are on foot every
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:116025:229"/>where every mans unlawful powers, as of Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the High Way, he bids them onely declare by what authority they had arrogated this whatſoever power to themſelves, and he would willingly anſwer to the things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; which if they could not, he adviſed them to avert the grievous crimes from their own heads and the kingdom; whatſoever they did, he reſolved not to betray the charge committed to him by God, and confirmed by ancient deſcent,</p>
               <p>The Preſident rejoynes that he was called to an account by authority of the people of <hi>England,</hi> by whoſe election he was admitted King.</p>
               <p>The king replyed the Kingdom deſcended to him in no wiſe elective, but hereditary above a thouſand years, that he ſtood more apparently for the Liberties of the People of <hi>England,</hi> by refuſing as unlawful and arbitrary authority, then the Judges or any other aſſerting it.</p>
               <p>That the authority and power of the people was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliamentary Aſſemblies, but that here appeared none of the Lords; who to the conſtituting of a Parliament ought to be there, and which is more, ſome King ought to be preſent, but that neither the one nor the other, nor both the Parliament Houſes, nor any other judicature on earth had any authority to call the King of <hi>England</hi> to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, much leſs ſome certain Judges choſen onely by his Accuſers, masked with the authority of the Lower Houſe and the ſame proculated.</p>
               <p>Howbeit he willed them again that they would at leaſt produce this their Authority, and he would not be wanting to his defence, foraſmuch is was the ſame offence with him to acknowledge a Tyrannical Power, as to reſiſt a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one.</p>
               <p>The preſident often interrupting the Kings Speech, told him that they were ſatisfied with the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r authority, as it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Gods authority, and the kingdom, in doing juſtice in this their preſent work.</p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:116025:230"/>
               <p>The Munday after the Court met in the Painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where it was reſolved that the king ſhould not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to argue the Courts Juriſdiction, but that the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhould tell him that the Commons in Parliament had conſtituted that Court, whoſe power was not to be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that if he refuſe to anſwer, it ſhall be accounted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy to the Court; that if he anſwer with a <hi>Salvo,</hi> his pretended Prerogative above the Court, he ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to anſwer poſitively yea or no; that he ſhall have a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of his Charge till he own the Court, and delare his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to anſwer on his ſecond Tryal. Sollicitor <hi>Cook</hi> moves that the Priſoner may make a poſitive anſwer, or that the Charge may be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> and the Court ot proceed to Juſtice. The Preſident repeats in brief the paſſages of the laſt day, and commands the King to anſwer to the Articles of the Charge, unleſs he had rather hear the Capital Sentence againſt him. The king perſiſts to interrogate concerning the Cauſe, and ſayes.</p>
               <p>That he leſs regards his life then his Honour, his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Laws, the Liberties of the people, all which that they ſhould not periſh together; there were weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why he ſhould not proſecute his defence before the Judges, and acknowledge a new form of Judicature; for what power had ever Judges to erect a Judicature againſt the King; or by what Law was it granted, ſure not by Gods Law, which on the contrary commands obedience to Princes; nor by Mans Laws, the Laws of our Land, ſith the Laws of <hi>England</hi> enjoyn all Accuſations to be read in the Kings Name, nor do they indulge any power, of judging the moſt abject Subject to the Lower (or Commons Houſe) neither laſtly their Power flow from any Authority (which might be pretended) extraordinary delegated from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeeing ye have not askt ſo much as every tenth man in this matter.</p>
               <p>The Preſident interrupting his Speech, rebukes the Kings,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:116025:230"/>and bids him be mindeful of his doom, affirming once more, that the Court was abundantly ſatisfied of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor was the Court to hear any reaſons that ſhould detract from their power.</p>
               <p>But what (ſayes the King) or where in all the world is that Court in which no place is left for reaſon.</p>
               <p>Yes, (anſwered the Preſident) you ſhall finde Sir; that this very Court is ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>But (the King preſſes) that they would at leaſt permit him to exhibit his reaſons in writing, which if they could ſatisfactorily anſwer, he would yield himſelf to their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</p>
               <p>Here the Preſident not content to deny, grew into anger, demanding the Priſoner to be taken away.</p>
               <p>The King replied no more to theſe things then; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (ſayes he) this is your King, from whom you turn away your ear, in vain certainly will my Subjects expect Juſtice from you who ſtop your ears to your King who is ready to plead his Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Saturday after the 27. of <hi>January</hi> before they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſixty eight of the Tryers anſwered to their names.</p>
               <p>The Preſident in a Scarlet Robe, and as the King Came, the Souldiers cryed out for Execution of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The King ſpeaks firſt, and deſires to be heard a word or two, but ſhort, and yet wherein he hopes not to give juſt occaſion wherein to be interrupted, and goes on. A ſudden Judgement (ſayes the King) is not ſo ſoon recall'd. But he is ſharply reproved of contumacy.</p>
               <p>The Preſident profuſely praiſes the patience of the Court, and commands him now at length to ſubmit, otherwiſe he ſhall hear the ſentence of of death reſolved upon by the Court againſt him.</p>
               <p>The King ſtill refuſes to plead his Cauſe before them, but that he had ſome things conducible to the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the peace of the Kingdom, which he deſires liberty
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:116025:231"/>to deliver before the Members of both Houſes.</p>
               <p>But the Preſident would not vouchſafe him ſo much as this favour, leaſt it ſhould tend (he ſaid) to the delay and retardation of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>To which the King replies, It were better to ſuſtain a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle delay of a day or two, then to precipitate a Sentence which will bring perpetual Tragedies upon the Kingdom, and miſeries to Children unborn.</p>
               <p>If (ſayes he) I ſought occaſion of delay, I would have made a more elabourate conteſtation of the Cauſe which might have ſerved to protract the time, and evade (at leaſt the while) a moſt ugly ſentence; but I will ſhew my ſelf a defender of the Laws, and of the Right of my Country, as to chuſe rather to dye for them, the Martyr of my People, then by proſtituting of them to an arbitrary power go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to acquire any manner of liberty for my ſelf, but I therefore requeſt this ſhort liberty of ſpeaking before a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Sentence be given; for that I well know, 'tis harder to be recall'd then prevented; and therefore I deſire that I may withdraw, and you conſider.</p>
               <p>They all withdraw, the King into <hi>Cottons Houſe,</hi> and the Tryers into the Court of Wards, and in half an hour return.</p>
               <p>The Preſident as he had begun, ſo he proceeds into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated Speech to haſten Sentence; which the King of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers reaſon to forbear, whileſt he might be heard before his Parliament, and this he requires as they will anſwer it at the dreadful day of Judgement, and to conſider it once again.</p>
               <p>But not prevailing, the Preſident goes on; wherein he aggravates the Contumacy of the King, and the hatefulneſs of the cimes, he aſſerts Parliamentary Authority, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Examples both Domeſtick and Forreign, &amp;c. his Treaſons he ſtiles a breach of Truſt to the Kingdom, as his Superiour, and is therefore called to an account <hi>minimus
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:116025:231"/>majorum in Judicium vocat;</hi> his murthers are many; all thoſe that have been committed in all the War betwixt him and his people are laid to his charge, all the innocent blood which cannot be cleanſed, but by the blood of him that ſhed the blood.</p>
               <p>So then for Tyranny, Treaſon, Murther, and many other crimes, he wiſhes the King to have God before his eyes, and that the Court calls God to witneſs, that mearly their Conſcience of Duty brings them to that place of this employment, and calls for Gods aſſiſtance in his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>The King offered to ſpeak to theſe great Imputations in the Charge; but he was told that his time was paſt, the Sentence was coming on, which the Preſident commanded to be read under this form.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Whereas the Commons of</hi> England <hi>have appointed them an High Court of Juſtice for the Trial of</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>before whom he hath been three times convented; and at the firſt time a Charge of High Treaſon and other Crimes and Miſdemeanours, were read in the behalf of the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. To which Charge he the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>was required to give his anſwer: and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt ſeveral paſſages at his Tryal in refuſing to anſwer, for all which Treaſons and Crimes the Court doth adjudge that the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer, and Publique Enemy ſhall be put to death, by the ſevering his Head from his Body.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>This Sentence (ſayes the Preſident) now read and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, is the Act, Sentence, Judgement, and Reſolution of the whole Court, to which the Members of the Court ſtood up, and aſſented to what he ſaid by holding up their hands.</p>
               <p>The King offered to ſpeak, but he was inſtantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be taken away, and the Court brake up.</p>
               <p>After the Sentence the King was hurried away, mockt and reviled by the Souldiers, they puft their Tobacco in his
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:116025:232"/>face, no ſmell being more offenſive to his father and him: ſuch as ſaluted him they baſtinadoed; one that did but ſigh, <hi>God have mercy,</hi> they cane'd; they intrude almoſt into his Cloſet, hardly permitting him his private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> Collonel <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Collonel <hi>Dean,</hi> Comiſſary General <hi>Ireton</hi> are to conſider of the time and place of his Execution, and in the Painted Chamber Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>January</hi> 29. the Preſident and Judges met, and within the Committee reſolve, that in the open ſtreet before <hi>White Hall</hi> (his own Houſe) is the fitteſt place; that the King be there executed to morrow Tueſday between ten and two of the Clock, upon a Scaffold covered with black, next to the Banquetting Houſe, where he was wont to aſcend his Throne.</p>
               <p>It was ſuppoſed the King would not ſubmit his neck to the Enemies Axe, and therefore it was ſo provided with ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and cords that he ſhould not reſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> 27. the King lodged at <hi>White Hall,</hi> the next day Sunday the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> preached before him.</p>
               <p>Afterwards his children had leave to viſit him, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being come to him, he firſt gave his bleſſing to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and bad her to tell her Brother <hi>James</hi> when ſoever ſhe ſhould ſee him, that it was his Fathers laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that he ſhould no more look upon <hi>Charles</hi> as his eldeſt Brother onely, but be obedient to him as his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; that they ſhould love one another and forgive their Fathers Enemies. Then ſaid the King to her. <hi>Sweet Heart you'l forget this, no</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>I ſhall never forget it whileſt I live,</hi> and pouring down abundance of tears promiſed him to write the Particulars. Then the King taking the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> upon his knee ſaid, <hi>Now they will cut off thy Fathers head,</hi> (upon which the childe lookt very ſtedfaſtly on him) <hi>Mark Childe what I ſay, they will cut off my head, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make thee a King.</hi> But mark what I ſay, <hi>You muſt
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:116025:232"/>not be King ſo long as your Brother</hi> Charles <hi>and</hi> James <hi>do live, for they will cut off your Brothers heads (when they can catch them) and cut off thy head too at last; therefore I charge thee do not be made a King by them,</hi> at which the Childe ſighing ſaid, <hi>I will be torn in pieces firſt,</hi> at which the King ſmiled.</p>
               <p>The fatal day appeared, <hi>Tueſday</hi> 30. <hi>January,</hi> when he prayes and receives the Sacrament, juſt at ten of the Clock in the forenoon he is called to come forth from St. <hi>James's</hi> Palace then his Priſon, to go on foot over the Park to <hi>White Hall,</hi> guarded with a Regiment of Foot Souldiers, part before and the reſt behinde him, with Collours flying and Drums beating, his private Guard of Partiſans about him, and Doctor <hi>Juxon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> next to him on one ſide, and Collonel <hi>Thomlinſon</hi> on the other.</p>
               <p>Aſcending the ſtairs up to the Park Gallery into his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Chamber, he continued there at his devotion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to dine, onely about twelve of the Clock, he eat a bit of bread, and drank a Glaſs of Clarret-wine; from thence he was conveyed into the Banquetting Houſe, and the great Window enlarged, out of which he aſcends the Scaffold: the Rails being hung round, and the floor covered with Black; the Executioners diſguiſed with vizards encountring him, he not affrighted ſhews more care of the people living, then fear of his own dying; for looking round about upon the people, whom the thick ſet Guards and Troops of Horſe kept a great diſtance off, and ſeeing he could not be heard by them, omitting probably what he purpoſed to have ſpoken to them, turning to the Officers and Actors, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Collonel <hi>Thomlinſon</hi> he ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I would now ſpeak nothing unto you in this place were it not that ſome men would interpret my ſilence as an argument of guilt, and think that I took on me the crimes objected with the ſame conſcience as I ſubmit to the puniſhment with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I call God to witneſs of my innocency, (before whoſe Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal I muſt ſhortly appear) it never entred into my thoughts

               <p>Mean while I acknowledge, and ſubmiſly own Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which this day (by an unjuſt ſentence of mine) he hath inflicted a juſt judgement on me, for as much as heretofore I would not quit an innocent man, (meaning the Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi>) when oppreſt by a moſt unjuſt decree.</p>
               <p>With what Charity I embrace my enraged enemies, this good man is my witneſs, (pointing to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>) I pardon them all from my very heart, and I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech the God of all mercies, that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to grant them ſerious repentance, and remit this great ſin.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot to my laſt gaſp, but be ſolicitous of the peace of my kingdom, which I am not able at the preſent better co conſult for, then by chalking out the way, from which you of the ſouldiery have exceedingly deviated, and by which we muſt return to ſobriety and peace.</p>
               <p>Herein I perceive, you are moſt miſerably out of the way, in that by the rule of the Sword without all, even a ſhadow of right you think good to wreſt the government to your ſelves, and endeavour to eſtabliſh the Kingdom, not by the authority of the Laws, but upon the ſcore of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt? which can never have any accruit of right, unleſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered in by a juſt Cauſe and Triumph of War; namely, either by the repulſing of wrongs, of recovering of rights unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detained.</p>
               <p>But if more proſperous ſucceſs ſhall advance the victor, beyond the modeſt bounds of juſt and lawful, nought hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but that the Kingdoms that are erected, both be, and be accounted great robberies, which we read heretofore, a Pirat objected to <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:116025:233"/>
               <p>But being out of the way (as you are) can you by no other expedient return into the the right wayes of peace, by no other counſel (believe me) can you hope to divert Gods wrath, then by reſtoring to God, the King, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, reſpectively ſuch things as are their dues.</p>
               <p>You ſhall give God his due by reſtoring his pure worſhip, and Church rightly regulated, according to the preſcript of his holy word, which hath long ſince been miſerably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſt and disjoynted. And this a national Synod duly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, will beſt effectuate, to the King, (namely my ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour) you will render full right, if you reſtore thoſe things which by the clear Letter of the Law ſtands expreſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly you will put the people in their rights and due li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, not by lifting them in the conſort of the Throne, and ſway of the Scepter, but by recovering unto the Laws there Authority, and the peoples obſervance to the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of which by the enormious power of the Sword, when as by no means I could be induced, I was brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to undergo Martyrdom for my people.</p>
               <p>So his laſt breath gently diſſolving into a moſt meek prayer, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſaid to him (thus) <hi>If his moſt excellent Majeſty pleaſed he would openly profeſs what he thought touching his Religion,</hi> not that any one alive could ſuſpect it, of which himſelf at all times throughont the whole ſpace of his life had given manifeſt teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>Whereupon (ſayes the King) that he depoſited the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his faith, which this holy man (meaning the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop) or elſe expected defence in this behalf of all men, who well knew his life and profeſſion, namely, <hi>that I dye,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>in the Chriſtion Faith, according to the profeſſion of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as the ſame was left me by my Father of bleſſed memory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then looking about upon the Officers, <hi>having</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>a moſt gracious God, and a moſt juſt cauſe, that I ſhall by and by change this corruptible Crown for an immortal one; I
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:116025:234"/>both truſt and rejoyce, that I ſhall depart hence into another Kingdom altogether exempt from all manner of diſturbance.</hi> Then preparing towards the Circumſtances, the Biſhop putting on his Night cap, and uncloathed him to his Sky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour Sattin Waſtecoat; he ſaid, <hi>I have a good cauſe, and a gracious God,</hi> and gave his <hi>George</hi> Order to the Biſhop, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to give it to the Prince.</p>
               <p>There is but one ſtage more, (ſayes the Biſhop) this is turbulent and troubleſome, and but a ſhort one, but it will ſoon diſmiſs into a way further, even from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there you are aſſured of joy and comfort. <hi>I go</hi> (ſayes the King) <hi>from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no diſturbance can be, but peace and joy for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, mildly praying to himſelf, he ſtoopt down to the Block as to a prayer-desk, and moſt humbly bowed down his generous Neck, to God, to be cut off by the vizarded Executioner, which was ſuddenly done at one blow. Thus fell <hi>Charles,</hi> and thus all Regal Power with him.</p>
               <p>His Body was buried at <hi>Windſor</hi> for to render him the more odious in the Vault with <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. His Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies at the Old Exchange being pulled down, with this Inſcription placed there, <hi>Sic exit ultimus Tyrannus.</hi> His own and his Fathers Statue being not long before thrown down from the Weſt end of <hi>Pauls.</hi>

               <p>THis honourable Perſon, though he was not like ſome of our other Worthies, crowned with the Succeſſes and Laurels of War; yet is he no leſs to be eternized for his endeavours, his animoſity, conſtancy, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to the parting firſt with his vaſte Eſtate, ſequeſtred for his Loyalty, and aterwards with his Life; ſo that he might

               </p>
               <p>He was Son and Heir to Sir <hi>Arthur Capel</hi> of <hi>Hadham-hall</hi> in <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> a Gentleman of a great eſtate, one who followed the old Mode of our Nation, kept a bountiful houſe, and ſhewed forth his faith by his works; extending his Charity in ſuch abundant manner to the poor, that he was bread to the hungry, drink to the thirſty, eyes to the blinde, and legs to the lame, and might juſtly be ſtiled <hi>Great Almoner to the King of Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Humility of this worthy Knight, (though it be too ſudden a diverſion) I ſhall preſume to inſert a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which I have heard delivered by ſome well acquainted with his worſhip; That be being ſet at his gate all alone, in a plain but decent habit, a Serving-man who had plumed himſelf with his Maſters caſt feathers came riding to him, and asked him if Sir <hi>Arthur Capel</hi> were within; Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Knight, he was there not long ago, and if you pleaſe to walk in you may hear further of his ſervants: Old Father ſaid the Serving-man, here take my Horſe and firſt money he ever received in that kinde; Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> agreed to the motion, and with a ſmile received from him a ſingle penny, took his Horſe and walkt him, whileſt the fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpruce Serving-man ſtrutted with convenient boldneſs into the houſe: but being informed by the Servants that their Maſter was at the Gate, he replying to the contrary, one of them to juſtifie their words, went with him to the Gate to ſee, where they found Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> very induſtrious in his employment; the Serving-man very much aſhamed of his miſtake, craved pardon, and with humble obeiſance, with his Hat in his hand, with many cringes, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Horſe from the Knight; <hi>Nay ſtay, ſayes Sir</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:116025:235"/>
                  <hi>you paid me my hire, get up as ſoon as you will, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſee you on Horſeback.</hi> The old Knight putting his hand into his purſe gave him half a peece, which he ſaid was for his taking ſo much care of his Maſters Horſe, being purpoſely thus liberal to encourage his own Servants to imitate his careful example.</p>
               <p>But to return to his Son, he was very well educated, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſome perfection in learning, he had a good expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and elegant ſtile, as his own Letters heſt delineate. His Father dying, as he inherited his Eſtate, ſo did he his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; his pious bounty appearing ſo conſpicuous, that ſome envious perſons who hate good works in others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will do none themſelves, have maliciouſly aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him for an inclination to Popery. But as ſuch aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt perſons of underſtanding ſpeak nothing but the ſpeakers malice, ſo wrought it in others a deſerved commendation of this of our late Noble inimitable Lord more eſpecially, that in theſe laſt times when Charity lies bed-rid, and faith onely ſo much talkt on, whereas he made his Faith publickly known by his Works.</p>
               <p>From the degree of Knight he was by King <hi>Charls</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be Baron of <hi>Hadham.</hi> As it may be computed about that time the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> received his Tryal, this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lord amongſt others, being one that gave his fatal Vote for the paſſing that Bill. In thoſe great differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt the King and Parliament, he conſtantly and faithfully adhered to his Majeſty, contributing very much to his aid, both in purſe and perſon: and at ſuch time as the King was ſecured in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> ſome hopes being given of his reſtauration to his former dignity by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> with a potent Army; as alſo of <hi>Langhorns, Powels,</hi> and <hi>Poyers</hi> declaring themſelves for his Majeſty, together with the riſing of the Countries in ſeveral places to the ſame unhappy purpoſe; he with a ſelected number of his friends, aſſociates, and ſervants, joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:116025:236"/>with the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and others, who with a great Party were up in Arms in <hi>Eſſex:</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving valiantly defended <hi>Colcheſter</hi> for the ſpace of three moneths, againſt a potent enemy ſated with ſucceſs, were at length (as I have already diſcourſed in the Life of Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi>) for want of proviſion forced to yield both it and themſelves, the ſuperior Officers to mercy, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers with the loſs of their flying Garments, the Townſmen to pay the mulct of fourteen thouſand pounds, which was above a thouſand pounds a moneth for the time that they held out the Siege. And for the Articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Cavaliers had made with General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> they could not but imagine that they had aſcertained their lives; yet notwithſtanding upon their ſurrender (as hath been mentioned) Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle</hi> were ſhot to death; which to all diſcerning men muſt needs ſeem ſtrange and unuſual, though the General in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Parliament calls it Military Execution; upon which the Houſe debated and ſent to the General to explain his Letter of the 29. of <hi>September.</hi> His head Quarters were then at Saint <hi>Albanes,</hi> from whence they had this anſwer, That the General doth not take upon him to conclude; but waving the buſineſs, leaves them to the Civil Power, and ſo in effect to Tryal for life. The Lord <hi>Capel</hi> and divers others were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where whileſt he remained he endeavoured an eſcape, and had effected it, had he not been betrayed by a ſecond <hi>Baniſter,</hi> a Water-man whom the Noble Lord intruſted himſelf with, who ignominiouſly for the lucre of a little money diſcovered him; not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this his misfortune, this honourable Lord, together with the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> was brought to a Tryal before a High Court of Juſtice in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall;</hi> where (for the brevity to omit the particulars) after a formal Tryal, they were all condemned: the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and the undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:116025:236"/>Welchman Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> (whom they made march on Foot to his Tryal) were reprieved. It hath been reported that the Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> who was ever pleaſantly conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſent to by a dear friend of his the day after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, to know what he conceived, as concerning the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his condition; who returned this anſwer, <hi>That he thought in all haſte to have put off his Doublet, but now he had leiſure to unhook his Breeches.</hi>

               <p>That which I can contribute towards this work, is, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſome few obſervations I made of him, and from him, before and after his condemnation. I was ſeveral times with him, and alwayes found him in a very <hi>chearful</hi>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:116025:237"/>and <hi>well compoſed</hi> temper of minde, proceeding from true <hi>Chriſtiun grounds,</hi> and not from a <hi>Roman reſolution</hi> onely; (as his <hi>enemies</hi> are pleaſed to ſpeak of him) he told me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it was the <hi>good God</hi> he ſerved and the <hi>good Cauſe</hi> he had ſerved for, that made him not to <hi>fear heath:</hi> adding, he had never had the temptation of ſo much as a thought to check him for his engagement in this <hi>quarrel,</hi> for he took it for his Crown and Glory, and wiſhed he had a greater ability and better fortune to engage in it.</p>
               <p>After his condemnation, and the afternoon before his ſuffering, we were a great while in private together; when, bewailing with that ſenſe which became a true (and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing) <hi>penitent,</hi> the ſins of his life paſt, the greateſt he could remember, was his <hi>voting my Lord of Straffords death;</hi> which though (as he ſaid) he did without any malice at all, yet he confeſſed it to be a very great ſin, and that he had done it out of a <hi>baſe fear</hi> (they were his own words) <hi>of a prevailing party;</hi> adding, that he had very often and very heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of it, and was confident of Gods pardon for it. Then he told me, he had a great deſire to receive the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament</hi> (ſo he called it) before he dyed the next morning: asking what <hi>Divine</hi> of the <hi>Kings party</hi> I would recommend to him; I replyed, that (though many were more worthy, yet) none would be more willing to do that ſervice then my ſelf; which he accepting very kindly, told me he durſt not deſire it, for fear it might be ſome danger to me. After this, and ſome conference in order to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, both for his <hi>viaticum</hi> and his <hi>voyage,</hi> the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and his <hi>death;</hi> he deſired me to <hi>pray</hi> with him, which after I had performed, and promiſed to be with him by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the next morning, I left him for that time to his <hi>own devotions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day I was there at the time aſſigned, and after ſome ſhort conference in order to the preſent occaſion, he deſired me to hear him pray; which he did for half an hour
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:116025:237"/>in an <hi>excellent method,</hi> very <hi>apt expreſſions,</hi> and moſt <hi>ſtrong, hearty,</hi> and <hi>paſſionate affections.</hi> Firſt, <hi>confeſſing</hi> and <hi>bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his <hi>ſins</hi> with ſtrong cries and tears: then humbly and moſt earneſtly deſiring Gods <hi>mercy,</hi> through the <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>Chriſt onely.</hi> Secondly for his dear <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> with ſome paſſion; but for her eſpecially with moſt ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: recommending them to the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> with great confidence and aſſurance; and deſiring for them rather the bleſſings of a better life, then of this. Thirdly, for the King, Church, and State. And laſtly, for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with almoſt the ſame ardour and affection. After this, ſending for my Lord of <hi>Norwich</hi> and Sir <hi>John Owen,</hi> I read the whole Office of the Church for <hi>Good Friday:</hi> and then, after a ſhort <hi>Homily</hi> I uſed for the preſent occaſion, we received the Sacrament, in which action he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with great <hi>Humility, Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> And being demanded after we had done, how he found himſelf, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, very much <hi>better, ſtronger,</hi> and <hi>chearfuller</hi> for that <hi>Heavenly repaſt;</hi> and that he doubted not to walk like a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> through the <hi>vale</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> in the ſtrength of it. But he was to have an <hi>Agony</hi> before his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and that was the parting with his <hi>Wife, eldeſt Son, Son-in-law,</hi> two of his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles,</hi> and Sir <hi>T. C.</hi> eſpecially the parting with his moſt <hi>dear Lady,</hi> which indeed was the ſaddeſt ſpectacle that ever I beheld. In which occaſion he could not chuſe but confeſs a little of humane frailty; yet even then he did not forget both to <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>counſel</hi> her, and the reſt of his friends, particularly in bleſſing the <hi>young Lord,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him never to revenge his death, though it ſhould be in his power: the like he ſaid unto his <hi>Lady.</hi> He told his <hi>Son</hi> he would leave him a <hi>Legacy</hi> out of <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> and that was this, <hi>Lord lead me in a plain path. For Boy,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I would have you a</hi> plain honeſt <hi>man, and hate</hi> diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</p>
               <p>After this with much ado, I perſwaded his Wife, and the
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:116025:238"/>reſt to be gone; and then being all alone with me, he ſaid, <hi>Doctor, The hardeſt part of my work in this world is now paſt,</hi> meaning the parting with his <hi>Wife.</hi> Then he deſired me to pray preparatively to his death, that in the laſt action he might ſo behave himſelf, as might be moſt for <hi>Gods glory,</hi> for the endearing of his <hi>dead Maſters memory,</hi> his <hi>preſent Maſters ſervice,</hi> and that he might avoid the doing or ſaying of any thing, which might ſavour either of <hi>ambition</hi> or <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> This being done, they were all carried to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> houſe, where I was with him, till he was called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scaffold, and would have gone up with him, but the Guard of Souldiers would not ſuffer me.</p>

               <p>The next that entered the liſts of death was the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> one whoſe oft changing from ſide to ſide had made him leſs acceptable in the eyes of the people, though the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of affairs altering their poſtures ſo often, may in part plead his excuſe; no doubt he was real in his laſt undertaking. He came to the Scaffold attended on by Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> &amp; having made a long ſpeech to the people, of his honeſt intentions for the good of the Kingdom, and deſiring of God that it would pleaſe him, the people might look upon the poſterity of the King, and that they might be called in again, after many fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers he had his head ſevered from his body: upon whom our forementioned Poet thus Satyrically goes on.</p>

               <p>Laſt of all our honoured Heroe mounted the Scaffold, to court grim death with an undaunted brow; he came not as the two-former attended with a Miniſter, having before prepared his way for death. Coming to the front of the Scaffold he ſaid as followeth.</p>
               <p>The concluſion that I made with thoſe that ſent me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are the cauſe of this violent death of mine, ſhall
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:116025:239"/>be the beginning of what I ſhall ſay to you, when I made an addreſs to them (which was the laſt) I told them with much ſincerity, that I would pray to the God of all mercies, that they might be partakers of his ineſtimable and boundleſs mercies in Jeſus Chriſt; and truly, I ſtill pray that prayer, and I beſeech the God of Heaven, forgive any injury they have done to me, from my ſoul I wiſh it, and truly this I tell you, as a Chriſtian, to let you ſee I am a Chriſtian; but it is neceſſary that I ſhould tell you ſomewhat more, That I am a Proteſtant, and truly I am a Proteſtant, and very much in love with the profeſſion of it, after the manner as it was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> by the thirty nine Articles; a bleſſed way of profeſſion, and ſuch a one, as truly I never knew none ſo good: I am ſo far from being a Papiſt, which ſome have very unworthily charged me withal that truly, I profeſs to you, that though I love good works, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend good works, yet I hold, they have nothing at all to do in the matter of Salvation: my Anchor hold is this, <hi>That Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> that is that I reſt upon! And truly ſomething I ſhall ſay to you as a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of the whole world, and in that conſideration I am here condemned to dye, contrary to the Law that governs all the world; that is, the Law of the Sword: I had the protection of that for my life, and the honour of it; but I will not trouble you much with this diſcourſe, becauſe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place I have ſpoken very largely and liberally of it. I believe you will hear by other means what arguments I uſed in that caſe: but truly, that that is a ſtranger, you that are Engliſh men, behold here an Engliſh man now before you, and acknowledged a Peer, not condemned to dye by any Law of <hi>England,</hi> not by any Law of <hi>England;</hi> nay, ſhall I tell you more (which is ſtrangeſt of all) contrary to all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> that I know of. And truly, I will tell you, in the matter of the civil part of my death, and the cauſe that I have maintained, I dye (I take it) for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:116025:239"/>the Fifth Commandment, enjoyned by God himſelf, which enjoyns Reverence and Obedience to Parents. All Divines on all hands, though they contradict one another in many ſeveral opinions, yet moſt Divines do acknowledge that here is intended Magiſtracy and Order; and certainly I have obeyed that Magiſtracy and that Order under which I have lived, which I was bound to obey; and truly, I do ſay very confidently, that I do dye here for keeping, for obeying that Fifth Commandment given by God himſelf, and written with his own Finger. And now Gentlemen, I will take this opportunity to tell you, That I cannot imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a better, nor a greater ingenuity then his, that ſaid of himſelf, <hi>For ſuffering an unjuſt judgement upon another, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was brought to ſuffer by an unjuſt judgement.</hi> Truly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that God may be glorified, that all men that are concerned in it may take the occaſion of it, of humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to God Almighty for it, I do here profeſs to you, that truly I did give my Vote to that Bill of the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> I doubt not but God Almighty hath waſhed that away with a more precious Blood, that is, with the Blood of his Son, and my dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and I hope he will waſh it away from all thoſe that are guilty of it. Truly, this I may ſay, I had not the leaſt part, nor the leaſt degree of malice in the doing of it; but I muſt confeſs again to Gods Glory, and the accuſation of my own frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the frailty of my nature, that truly it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy cowardize, not to reſiſt ſo great a torrent as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried that buſineſs at that time. And truly, this I think I am moſt guilty of, but malice I had none; but whatſoever it was, God I am ſure hath pardoned it, hath given me the aſſurance of it, that Chriſt Jeſus his Blood hath waſhed it away; and truly, I do from my ſoul wiſh, that all men that have any ſtain by it, may ſeriouſly repent, and receive a remiſſion and pardon from God for it. And now Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, we have had an occaſion by this intimation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:116025:240"/>his Majeſty, our King that laſt was; and I cannot ſpeak of him, nor think of it, but I muſt needs ſay, that in my opinion, that have had time to conſider all the Images of all the greateſt and vertuouſeſt Princes in the world; and truly, in my opinion, there was not a more vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and more ſufficient Prince known in the world, then our gracious King <hi>Charles</hi> that dyed laſt: God Almighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our King that now is, his Son; God ſend him more fortunate and longer dayes; God Almighty ſo aſſiſt him, that he may exceed both the vertues and ſufficiences of his Father: for certainly, I that have been a Councellour to him, and have lived long with him, and in a time when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is eaſily enough made, for he was young (he was about fifteen or ſixteen years of age) thoſe years I was with him, truly I never ſaw greater hopes of vertue in any young perſon then in him; great judgement, great underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtrong apprehenſions, much honour in his nature, and truly, a very perfect Engliſh man in his inclinations. I pray God reſtore him to this Kingdom, and unite the Kingdoms one to another, to the happineſs both of you and him, that he may long live and reign among you, and that that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily may reign till thy Kingdom come, that is, while all temporal power is conſumated: I beſeech God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, give much happineſs to this your King, and to you that in it ſhall be his Subjects, by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Truly, I like my beginning ſo well, that I will make my concluſion with it, that is, That God Almighty would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of his infinite and ineſtimable grace and mercy, to thoſe that are the cauſers of my coming hither; I pray God give them as much mercy as their own hearts can wiſh; for my part I will not accuſe any one of them of malice, truly I will not; nay, I will not think there was any malice in them; what other ends there are I know not, nor I will not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but let it be what it will, from my very ſoul I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them every one: and ſo, the Lord of Heaven bleſs
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:116025:240"/>you all, God Almighty be infinite in goodneſs and mercy to you, and direct you in thoſe wayes of obedience to his commands to his Majeſty, that this Kingdom may be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and glorious Nation again, and that your King may be a happy King in ſo good and ſo obedient people; God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty keep you all, God Almighty preſerve this Kingdom, God Almighty preſerve you all.</p>
               <p>Having ended his Speech, he called for the Executioner, on whom he beſtowed five pounds, ſaying to him, <hi>I not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgive thee from my ſoul, but deſire of God to give thee grace for a better employment.</hi> Having ſtood ſtill a while he ſaid, <hi>God Almighty ſtench this blood, God Almighty ſtench, ſtench, ſtench this iſſue of blood, this will not do the buſineſs; God Almighty finde out another way to do it.</hi> Then having taken his leave of thoſe friends and ſervants that were about him, he addreſt himſelf to prayer, and upon a ſign given by him, had his head ſevered from his body by the Executioner.</p>

               <head>The Life of JAMES Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardine,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange in ſuch a ſcarcity of Scotch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, there alſo being already ſo many of our own, that I ſhould go about to borrow one from that Countrey,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:116025:241"/>where if <hi>Diogenes</hi> were alive again, the Cinique, as I have heard one merrily expreſs, with his Lanthorn, would make no long inqueſt after ſuch an impoſſibility, but infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly conclude, that there is not ſuch another to be found in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This renowned Marqueſs was extracted from the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and famous Family of the <hi>Grahams</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe valiant and loyal Actions have eternized their Names to all poſterity. His Grandfather and Father were advanced by King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> unto places of the greateſt honour in that Kingdom: which they moſt happily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, with the love and good affection both of King and People. This Honourable Perſon (whoſe Life we now relate) perſiſting in his Predeceſſours ſteps, may give us cauſe to think that Valour and Loyalty were entailed on that Family.</p>
               <p>Yet at firſt he ſided with the Covenanters againſt the Royal Party, they pretending to nothing then, <hi>leſs then the preſervation of Religion, the Honour and Dignity of the King, the Laws of the Land, and the Freedom of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But having found that thoſe fair tales were onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, and onely coyned of purpoſe to draw people to their ſide, he like a wiſe man finding their hearts aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King, he mediated a diſengagement; but finding the work difficult, he a while diſſembled his intent, ſeeming as active as he was before, that when time ſerved he might diſſert them to better purpoſe, having alſo many of his friends amongſt them, whom he hoped to draw off; by which means he ſhould be able to gather no ſmall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which would conduce much both to the Kings ſafety and his own.</p>
               <p>Whileſt he was upon theſe determinations, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters had raiſed a ſtrong Army, and in a ſolemn conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Duns,</hi> they determine to invade <hi>England; Montroſs</hi> ſeeing he could not hinder thoſe actions, would not ſeem
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:116025:242"/>to diſapprove of them; and having the command of two thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, to ſeem the more active, was the firſt man that ſet foot on Engliſh ground; and had his friends fulfilled their promiſes, he had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken to pieces the Covenanters deſigns, but in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability had brought the whole Army along with him to the King. But the Scots marching over the <hi>Tine,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he expected, he was much diſappointed of that opportunity he ſo longingly attended; yet he kept the ſame loyal Inclinations towards the King, which (taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Treaty that enſued betwixt them) that he found means to acquaint his Majeſty by Letters, wherein he proteſted his faith and ready obedience to him: but theſe Letters being ſtoln out of the Kings pockets by his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber men, (the ſuppoſed inſtruments of <hi>Hamilton</hi>) and by them coppied out, were ſent to the Covenanters at <hi>New Caſtle,</hi> which place by the treachery of ſome Engliſh Commanders was yielded unto them, who concealing their Information, did not withal conceal their malignity againſt the Earl, but laboured all they could to render him odious to the people, and thereby unſerviceable to his Majeſty. Nor wanted they fit inſtruments for this purpoſe, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obliged to themſelves moſt of the Preachers through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, they made uſe of their mercenary tongues, to rail againſt the King and his faithful Subjects, as the enemies of Chriſt; being themſelves the while the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhame and ſcandal of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill <hi>Montroſs</hi> goes on in his Loyal intentions, and joyns to his ſide many of the prime men for Nobility and Power, though ſome of them afterwards for fear betrayed their deſigns unto the Covenanters; ſo that on a ſudden when he ſuſpected nothing, he with <hi>Napier</hi> Lord of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Sterling Keer</hi> were committed Priſoners to the Caſtle in <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> But a Pacification being made betwixt both Kingdoms, he with his friends were ſet again at liberty.</p>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:116025:242"/>
               <p>Not long after in <hi>England</hi> happened thoſe fatal diſcords betwixt the King and Parliament; which growing ſo high, that they came to be determined by the Sword: the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters not to be wanting in the aid of their Confederates, reſolved to raiſe a puiſſant Army; and to oblige <hi>Montroſs</hi> to their ſide, proffered him freely the Office of Lieutenant General of the Army, and what ever elſe he could deſire, and they beſtow. But he not more careleſs of their prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers then careful to inform the King of the danger that hereby hung over his head, to which purpoſe he poaſts into <hi>England,</hi> taking onely the Lord <hi>Ogleby</hi> into his counſel and company.</p>
               <p>At <hi>York</hi> he informs the Queen of the covenanters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and of the danger that would enſue thereof; which doubtleſs had taken good effect at that time, had not the coming of Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> out of <hi>Scotland</hi> (upon pretence of kiſſing the Queens hand, but with intent to overthrow <hi>Montroſs</hi> his councels) hindered the ſame, who perſwaded the Queen there was no fear of any Army, nor that the King ſhould need deſpair of amity and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them; proteſting he himſelf would be active for the King with his perſon and eſtate.</p>
               <p>But the Covenanters proceeding on in their deſigns, and <hi>Montroſs</hi> having better knowledge of their intentions then before, he goes to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and delares the ſame to the King himſelf; but the King was ſo ſoothed up with Letters of the contrary from <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and ſome ſuch other Courtiers alſo buzzing in his ears <hi>Montroſſes</hi> youth, his raſhneſs, his ambition, the envy and hatred he bare unto the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and on the other ſide the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> fidelity, their honeſty, their diſcretion, their power; ſo that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs</hi> nothing prevailed. In the mean time the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were not idle, but having raiſed an Army of eighteen thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe, march for <hi>England;</hi> and now the King (when it was too late) ſeeing
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:116025:243"/>himſelf thus groſſy abuſed, ſends for <hi>Montroſs,</hi> and asks his advice what was beſt to be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſs</hi> having declared the deſperate eſtate <hi>Scotland</hi> was in at that preſent, and how abominably his Majeſty had been betrayed by them with whom he had entruſted his ſecrets, reſolved nevertheleſs, if the King would lay his Commands upon him, nothing diſtruſting Gods aſſiſtance in a righteous cauſe, he would undertake his cauſe, and uſe his beſt endeavours. The King applauding his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reſolution, giving him thanks, encouraged him to fit himſelf chearfully for ſo great a work; and the better to carry on the deſign, the King ſent the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who engaged himſelf to be with <hi>Montroſs</hi> in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile,</hi> (a part of <hi>Scotland</hi> bordering upon <hi>Ireland</hi>) with ten thouſand men by the firſt of <hi>April</hi> 1644. this promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt to him in <hi>December</hi> 1643. for a ſTock of men to ſet up withal; the King wrote to the Marqueſs of <hi>New Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> to furniſh him with aid, and ſent Sir <hi>John Cockeram</hi> his Ambaſſadour, with a Commiſſion and Inſtruction for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Aids and Arms. This being done, he ſets forward in his journey from <hi>Oxford</hi> towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> having in his company about two hundred Horſe, moſt of them Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen, who had formerly been Commanders in Forreign Countreys. Being come to <hi>Durham,</hi> he ſends the Kings Inſtructions to the Marqueſs of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the next day they met and conferred; but <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> wants were ſo great, that he could ſpare him at preſent onely an hundred Horſe, and two Braſſe Field Peeces; but ſent his Orders to his Officers and Commanders in <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> to afford him all the aſſiſtance they could, who accordingly met him near to <hi>Carlile</hi> with eight hundred Foot, and three Troops of Horſe. With theſe ſmall Forces he enters <hi>Scotland,</hi> but having come to the River <hi>Anan,</hi> upon occaſion of a Mutiny among the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, moſt of them fly their Colours, and run back to
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:116025:243"/>
                  <hi>England.</hi> Notwithſtanding he with his own men came to <hi>Dumfriſe,</hi> and took the Town into protection upon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, where he ſtayed a while, that he might be ready to entertain <hi>Antrim</hi> and his Iriſh; but the time appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt, and no news ſtirring of them, the Covenanters gathering themſelves together on every ſide, to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from being ſurprized, he returns to <hi>Carlile.</hi> And not loving to lie idle, joyns with the Kings Forces in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> takes the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Morpet,</hi> as alſo an hundred Foot at the mouth of the River of <hi>Tine,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards victuals <hi>New Caſtle;</hi> then intending to joyn his Forces with Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who was coming to raiſe the Siege at <hi>York,</hi> he made all the haſte he could, but met him not till he was upon his retreat, the day after that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Battle: All things thus failing him, he returns to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,</hi> and ſends the Lord <hi>Ogleby</hi> and Sir <hi>William Rolluck</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to diſcover the ſtate of the Countrey; who returning back, brought him word, that all things were in a deſperate condition, and therefore counſelled him to bend his courſe ſome other way.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Montroſs</hi> thinking it unworthineſs in him to deſpair of ſo good a cauſe, reſolves upon a ſtrange adventure, for delivering thoſe few Gentlemen that had been conſtant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to the Lord <hi>Ogleby,</hi> to be conducted to the King: he with Sir <hi>William Rolluck,</hi> and one <hi>Sibbald,</hi> being diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, entred <hi>Scotland, Montroſs</hi> paſſing as <hi>Sibbalds</hi> man. Thus making all the haſte they could, they came at laſt to the houſe of his Couzen <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> of <hi>Innisbrake,</hi> not far from the River of <hi>Tay</hi> in the Sherifdom of <hi>Perth;</hi> not long had he been there, but he receives news of eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Iriſh ſent over by <hi>Antrim,</hi> who were then upon the Mountains; who being made to underſtand of his being there, they came marching unto him, and ſubmitted to his command.</p>
               <p>The next day the men of <hi>Athol,</hi> to the number of eight
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:116025:244"/>hundred, put themſelves in Arms, and joyned with <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs;</hi> ſo that now having gotten this handful of men, he deſires to be in action; impatient therefore of further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, he marches from thence, with a reſolution to ſet upon his enemies: and having marched as far as <hi>Bucknith,</hi> five hundred more under the command of the Lord <hi>Kilpont.</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Taith,</hi> joyned with him, by whom he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the Covenanters were thick in Arms at a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz at <hi>Perth;</hi> whereupon with all the haſte he could, he ſpeedeth thither: theſe were commanded by the Lord <hi>Elcho,</hi> who upon <hi>Montroſſes</hi> approach provided to fight; they were in number ſix thouſand Foot and ſeven hundred Horſe, ſo that contemning the paucity of their enemies, they grew to a fooliſh confidence of Victory; but <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſo well ordered his Army that their confidence failed them, for joyning Battel they were overthrown, two thouſand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain, and more taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Perth</hi> upon this overthrow, ſubmitted her ſelf to the Conquerour, to whom he did not the leaſt harm; where having ſtaid three dayes, many of his Athol men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, he marches with the reſt of his Forces to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdeen;</hi> but the Town having a ſtrong Garriſon therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſubmit and he thinking it no wiſdom to hazard the honour he had gotten by his late Victory upon the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſucceſs of a Siege, turns away towards <hi>Esk,</hi> whither came to him the Lord <hi>Ogleby</hi> with his two Sons, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and Sir <hi>David,</hi> who with admirable conſtancy continued with him to the very end of the War.</p>
               <p>And now receiving intelligence that an Army of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, under the command of the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> lay at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> with long marches he hies thither, ſets upon them, and after a long fight puts them to the rout, with the loſs of almoſt all their Foot; who flying for refuge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, <hi>Montroſſes</hi> men came in thronging amongſt them, through the Gates and Poſterns, and laid them on
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:116025:244"/>heaps all over the Streets. This Battel was fought <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the 12. 1644. After this defeat <hi>Montroſs</hi> calling his Souldiers back to their Colours, entred the City, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them two dayes reſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean time news was brought that <hi>Argile</hi> was hard by with far greater Forces then thoſe they had dealt with laſt; whereupon he removes to <hi>Kintor,</hi> a Village ten miles off from <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> expecting ſome of the <hi>Gordons</hi> would have joyned with him; but none appearing he reſolved to withdraw his Forces into the Mountains and Faſtneſſes, for though he had fought twice indeed very proſperouſly, it could not be expected that ſeeing he was ſo beſet on all ſides with great and numerous Armies, he ſhould be able to hold out alwayes without relief: whereupon hiding his Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in a Bog, he marches to an old Caſtle called <hi>Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murk,</hi> intending to paſs over the River of <hi>Spey,</hi> but on the other ſide were the number of five thouſand up in Arms to hinder his paſſage; wherefore to ſave his Army from being oppreſſed with the enemies Horſe, he turned into <hi>Badenoth,</hi> a Rocky and Mountainous Countrey; here he fell very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſick, but recovering again, he ſends <hi>Mac-donel</hi> who commanded the Iriſh, with a Party into the Highlands, to invite them to take up Arms with him, and if they would not be invited, to force them; he himſelf paſſes into the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having ſtaid a while for recruit at <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> he removed to <hi>Faivy Caſtle</hi> and poſſeſt it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure now as he thought from <hi>Argile,</hi> his confidence had well near deſtroyed him, he and <hi>Lothian</hi> with 2500. Foot, and 1200 Horſe, having undiſcovered come within two miles of him. <hi>Montroſs</hi> to repair his Scouts negligence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but 1500. Foot, and 50. Horſe, draws them up to a high craggy Hill, which over-looked the Caſtle, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had appointed every one his ground to draw up in, many of his Souldiers fairly run away; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their cowardiſe, he ſo behaved himſelf with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:116025:245"/>that though <hi>Argile</hi> ſeveral dayes attempted to aſſault him, he carried away nothing with him but loſs and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſs</hi> being now deſirous to joyn with <hi>Mac-donel</hi> and thoſe Highlanders he had raiſed, takes the advantage of the night, and returns to <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> whither alſo <hi>Argile</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him, and endeavours by great promiſes to draw away his Souldiers from him. <hi>Montroſs</hi> to prevent his deſigns, marches from thence to <hi>Balveny</hi> and ſo to <hi>Badenoth,</hi> yet had <hi>Argiles</hi> promiſes wrought ſuch effects in many of the Gentry and prime Souldiers, that they ſhamefully deſerted him: <hi>Montroſs</hi> looking upon their revolt with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſcorn, haſtes into <hi>Athol,</hi> and joynes with <hi>Macdonel. Argile</hi> at that time lay at <hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> but being frighted with the report of <hi>Montroſſes</hi> coming, when he was yet ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles off, he bid his men ſhift for themſelves, and he himſelf fled as faſt as he could to <hi>Perth. Montroſs</hi> hereupon paſſes into the Country of <hi>Argile,</hi> and harazes the ſame with Fire and Sword; and hearing that the Earl of <hi>Seafort</hi> with five thouſand Horſe and Foot were near at hand, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to fight them; but whileſt he was preparing againſt him, he had information that the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Forces out of the lower parts of the Kingdom, and joyned unto them ſuch Highlanders as yet adhered unto him, containing in all about three thouſand Foot, were at an old Caſtle called <hi>Innerligh</hi> upon the Bank of <hi>Logh-Aber,</hi> ſome thirty miles of him, which cauſed him to march in all haſte through untrodden paths, and was on their backs ere they were aware, and giving them Battel overthrew them, having the killing of them with a moſt horrible ſlaughter for nine miles together; no leſs then 1500. being killed, among whom were very many Gentlemen of the <hi>Campbels,</hi> whoſe deaths were anſwerable to their names, dying in <hi>Campo belli,</hi> in the Field of War. <hi>Argile</hi> himſelf eſcaped by Boat, many of the conquered fled into the Caſtle, which
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:116025:245"/>was ſoon after ſurrendered to <hi>Montroſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Long ſtaid he not there, but returns again by the coaſts of <hi>Harrick, Arne,</hi> and <hi>Narne,</hi> a great party of his enemies being aſſembled at <hi>Elgin,</hi> upon the news of his approach diſperſed themſelves, leaving the Caſtle of <hi>Elgin</hi> unto him, here the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> eldeſt Son to the Marqueſs of <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> with a ſelect number of his friends and clients joyned themſelves to him; having now two thouſand Foot and two hundred Horſe he marches to <hi>Brechin,</hi> where he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Sir <hi>John Hurrey</hi> General of the Horſe for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters was with a great party of Horſe, whom he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and puts to flight; and underſtanding that <hi>Bailey</hi> a Commander of great account had been fetcht out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to withſtand him, he reſolves to give him Battel, and thereupon goes againſt him; but having in vain often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him thereunto, many of his Souldiers alſo deſerting him, he was forced with much difficulty and hazard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to the Mountains.</p>
               <p>And now being out of his enemies reach, he ſends the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> to levy new Forces, whileſt he with a ſmall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty marches through <hi>Angus</hi> into <hi>Pertſhire,</hi> that he might diſtract the enemy till ſuch time he made up his Army: <hi>Bailey</hi> underſtanding where he was, intends to ſurprize him, but he found <hi>Montroſs</hi> provided for him, who ſo valiantly repulſed his aſſault, that by killing ſome and routing others he forced them to a retreat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurrey</hi> having thus before miſt his market on <hi>Montroſs</hi> intended to make it up on the Lord <hi>Gordon; Montroſs</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould be over-maſtered, thought it neceſſary to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Hurrey</hi> as ſoon as was poſſible, as well to ſecure ſo dear a friend from ſo eminent danger, as to be nibbling at the enemies Forces, as he found them aſunder, and to cut off that power by peace-meal, which he well knew, if it were all in a body would be above his ſtrength; therefore by long and continued journeyes, he marches into <hi>Marre,</hi> and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:116025:246"/>joyns with the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> who had raiſed a thouſand Foot, and two hundred Horſe; and indeed it was but time, <hi>Hurry</hi> having gotten within ſix miles of him, who underſtanding of <hi>Montroſſes</hi> coming, retires with al ſpeed he could to <hi>Innerneſs: Montroſs</hi> as haſtily followeth after him, here the Earls of <hi>Seafort</hi> and <hi>Sunderland,</hi> the whole ſept of the <hi>Fraſers,</hi> and moſt of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Cathneſs,</hi> and the neighbouring parts joyned with <hi>Hurry,</hi> ſo that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs</hi> fearing to be over-powred had a great minde to retire; but not onely <hi>Hurry</hi> preſſed ſo vehemently upon him, that it was ſcarce poſſible for him to retreat, but <hi>Baily</hi> alſo with a Southern Army, much ſtronger then <hi>Hurry's,</hi> was gotten betwixt the Mountains and him, ſo that fearing to be hem'd in between two Armies, he reſolves to try the fortune of War without delay, and commit the ſucceſs to God; to gain much advantage as he could, he marſhalls his Army, and gives them Battel, which was fought with much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and eagerneſs on both ſides; each part ſtriving to outvie the other in valour; at length the Covenanters were overthrown, three thouſand of their Foot Souldiers being ſlain, but moſt of their Horſe eſcaped by a more timely then honourable flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurry</hi> with his broken Troops fled unto <hi>Baily,</hi> after whom <hi>Montroſs</hi> (having a few dayes refreſhed his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) followed after, whom <hi>Baily</hi> provokes unto Battel, which he refuſed, yet nevertheleſs by frequent skirmiſhes, and eſpecially breaking up their quarters in the night, be ſo weakened their power and courage, that as well Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders as Souldiers, haſtily and diſorderly betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by night to <hi>Innerneſs</hi> when none purſued them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> the prime ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of the Covenasters next unto <hi>Argile,</hi> had raiſed a new Army, and had paſſed over with his Forces into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> intending to be a reſerve unto <hi>Baily; Montroſs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to quell this new Army, marches againſt him with
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:116025:246"/>ſuch ſpeed, that the news of his approach was not ſo ſwift as himſelf; and now <hi>Lindſey</hi> was not above ſeven miles from him, and all things ready for an aſſault, when (upon what occaſion it is uncertain) almoſt all the Northern men privately ran away from their Colours, and going back the way that they came, return into their Countrey; by which means that Victory ſlipt thorow his fingers, which he had almoſt graſped in his hand.</p>
               <p>Therefore taking up new reſolutions, he ſendeth the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> and <hi>Mac-donel</hi> to levy more Forces; and now <hi>Lindſey</hi> pretending to do ſome famous exploit, takes a thouſand old Souldiers from <hi>Baily,</hi> leaving him as many new rais'd men in their rooms: <hi>Montroſs</hi> having notice hereof, deſires to fight him, and ſends a Trumpet to offer a ſet Battle; but <hi>Baily</hi> anſwers, he would not receive order to fight from an Enemy. Yet at laſt through the raſhneſs of the Lord <hi>Balcariſe,</hi> a Collonel of Horſe, who precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated himſelf and the Horſe under his command into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he was forced thereunto; whereupon a bloody Fight enſued, wherein <hi>Baily</hi> was overthrown, with the loſs of the greateſt part of his Army. This Battel was fought at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> on the 2. of <hi>July,</hi> 1645.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſs</hi> having obtained this Victory, marches into <hi>Angus,</hi> where he met his Couzen <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> with his Athol men ready to live and dye under his command, and <hi>Mac-donel</hi> with a great power of Highlanders; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforced with ſuch an Army, he reſolves to make his way into the very heart of the Kingdom: and paſſing over the <hi>Tay</hi> at <hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> encamped in <hi>Methfyn Forreſt;</hi> the Covenanters at that time held a Parliament at Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Town, but hearing of <hi>Montroſſes</hi> approach, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured themſelves by flight: he to encreaſe their terrour, drew nearer to the Town; but finding it not ſafe for him to deſcend into the Champion Countrey, having ſuch want of Horſe, he retreated to little <hi>Dunkeldon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:116025:247"/>
               <p>But that want was ſoon ſupplied by a Party from the North, under the Earl of <hi>Aboine,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> and Sir <hi>David</hi> his ſon; ſo that being now thus recruited, he thought it not good to loſe any time, but marched ſtraight towards the Enemy. And having in vain ſeveral times proffered them Battle, at laſt it came to a pitcht Field in a place called <hi>Kilſythe,</hi> where the Covenanters though they overmatcht him in number, yet came ſo far behinde him in valour, that he obtained over them an abſolute Victory, having the killing of them for fourteen miles; ſo that of all their Foot it is thought there did not an hundred come off, nor did their horſe eſcape very well, of whom ſome were killed, ſome taken, the reſt diſperſt. Their Ordnance, their Arms, their Spoils came clearly to the Conquerours, who loſt onely ſix of their men, on the other ſide were ſlain ſix thouſand, a great diſproportion in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and did not the effects which followed this Victory make it the more credible, it might ſeem to ſome a falſhood, if not an impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>For preſently afterwards was a great alteration all the Kingdom over, the chief of the Nobility who ſided with the Covenanters, ſome fled to <hi>Barwick,</hi> ſome to <hi>Carlile,</hi> ſome to <hi>New Caſtle,</hi> others into <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Limmuck, Annandale,</hi> and <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field;</hi> the Lord Barrons of <hi>Seton, Drummond, Fleming, Maderly, Carnegy,</hi> and <hi>Jonſton,</hi> with many others of great quality ſubmitted themſelves: ſuch as before onely privately wiſht well unto the King, now expreſſed it openly. The Cities and Countreys that were furtheſt off, began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch their Commiſſioners to profeſs in their names their Allegiance to their King, their duty and ſervice to his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, and freely to offer him Men, Arms, Proviſion, and other neceſſaries of War. The City of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate themſelves with the Conquerours, they releaſed their Priſoners, of whom the chiefeſt were the Earl of
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:116025:247"/>
                  <hi>Crawford,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Ogleby,</hi> ſon to the Earl of <hi>Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> whom with their Delegates they ſent to <hi>Montroſs</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for peace, proffering ſubmiſſion, and promiſing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for the time to come; yea, the whole Kingdom every where ſounded nothing but <hi>Montroſſes</hi> praiſe. But what thing on earth is permanent many of his Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loaden with ſpoil, ran privily away from their Colours, and returned home. Preſently after their very Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders deſired Furloghs for a little while, pretending that the Enemy had no Army within the borders of the Kingdom, and therefore their ſervice for the preſent might very well be ſpared; the Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> (whether the Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would or no) carried away with him not onely his own men, but all the reſt of the Northern Forces: yea, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Macdonel,</hi> who had hitherto continued ſo faithful, departed into the Highlanders with more then three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtout men, and ſixſcore of the beſt Iriſh, promiſing with a ſolemn oath their ſudden return, yet he never ſaw <hi>Montroſs</hi> after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſeeing it would be no better, with his ſmall Army paſſing by <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> (into which he would not enter, by reaſon the plague then raged in the City) led them through <hi>Lothainſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Strathgale</hi> joyned with ſome Forces raiſed by the Marqueſs of <hi>Douglaſs;</hi> afterwards he marches to <hi>Niddiſdale</hi> and <hi>Annandale,</hi> and the Countrey of <hi>Ayre,</hi> that he might there raiſe what Horſe he could; and coming to <hi>Selkirk,</hi> he quartered his Horſe in a Village, and his Foot in a Wood cloſe by. His Army conſiſting of onely five hundred Foot, and thoſe Iriſh, and a very weak party of new rais'd Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſley</hi> underſtanding of his weak condition, (having been newly ſent for out of <hi>England</hi> to help the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their exigency) with ſix thouſand Horſe made ſuch ſpeed, that before he was diſcryed by <hi>Montroſſes</hi> Scouts, he was not above half a mile off; <hi>Montroſs</hi> at that preſent
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:116025:248"/>was very buſie in diſpatching Letters to the King, but upon news of <hi>Leſley's</hi> coming he mounts the firſt horſe he could light on, and gallops into the Field appointed for the Rendezvouz, where he findes a great deal of noiſe, but no order. The Cavalry being little acquainted with duty, and lying already diſperſed in their quarters, where they dreamt more of baiting their horſes, then maintaining their lives and honours; yet there were a few, and thoſe were for the moſt part Noblemen and Knights, who made all ſpeed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gallantly undertook to make good the right Wing: but they being not above ſixſcore in all, and being aſſailed by ſo potent an Enemy, multitude overcoming va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, having twice repulſed their Enemy with loſs, at laſt they betook themſelves to flight, the Foot fighting a good while ſtoutly and reſolutely, were forced to yield, but found little mercy from the Conquerour, putting them all to the Sword. <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſeeing his men routed, (which he never ſaw before) rallying about thirty Horſe whom he had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up in that confuſion, he deſperately chargeth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Enemy, who hotly purſuing him, to make his flight the more honourable, he chargeth his purſuers, routs them, and carries away one <hi>Bruce</hi> a Captain of Horſe, and two Cornets with their Standards Priſoners.</p>
               <p>And now being ſafe from danger, he makes what haſte he could into <hi>Athole,</hi> to recruit his Army, <hi>Aboine</hi> bringing him fifteen hundred Foot, and three hundred Horſe; with ſome addition of the Athol men, he croſſeth the <hi>Forth,</hi> and came into <hi>Leven,</hi> which he deſtroyed without any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but his Forces too weak to reſiſt ſo powerful an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as the Enemy had then in the Field, he returneth back into the Countrey of <hi>Athole,</hi> and goeth himſelf in perſon to <hi>Bogie Caſtle</hi> upon the mouth of <hi>Spey,</hi> to ſpeak with <hi>Huntley;</hi> (having by meſſengers often fruitleſly ſollicited him to joyn with him) as ſoon as they met, <hi>Montroſs</hi> invited him in ſmooth and gentle language to aſſociate
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:116025:248"/>with him him in the War for the ſafety of the King and Kingdom, and gave him ſo full ſatisfaction in all things, that as being at laſt overcome, he ſeemed to give him his hand, and promiſed that not onely all his men, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would come in perſon in the head of them, and be with him with all poſſible ſpeed. And for the better mannaging of the War, they agreed that <hi>Huntley</hi> waft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the <hi>Spey,</hi> ſhould make his way on the right hand, by the Sea Coaſt of <hi>Murrey,</hi> and <hi>Montroſs</hi> was to go round about on the left hand thorow <hi>Strath-Spey,</hi> and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Innernes</hi> (a ſtrong Garriſon of the Covenanters) on both ſides.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a convention of the Eſtates was held at Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> wherein were condemned and executed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Nathanel Gordon,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Spotſwood, Andrew Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therey,</hi> Son to the Biſhop of <hi>Murray,</hi> and <hi>William Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Tullibardin.</hi> The crimes object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them was no leſs then High Treaſon; the facts they were guilty of, <hi>Loyalty to the King;</hi> for the ſame cauſe was beheaded not long before Sir <hi>William Rollock, Alexander Ogleby,</hi> of an ancient and honourable Family, and Sir <hi>Philip Nesbit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The death of his Friends troubled <hi>Montroſs</hi> exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet abhorring their cruelty by inflicting the like on thoſe Priſoners he had of theirs, he reſolved to revenge their deaths in a more nobler way, and with his Army marched to beſiege <hi>Innerneſs,</hi> the moſt conſiderable Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all the North, and the Haven there moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for entertaining Forreign Forces. Now had <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> with his Army come up to have blocked up that ſide of the Town he undertook to do, the Garriſon for want of proviſion had been forced to yield: but he trifling away his time in <hi>Murray,</hi> a good way off <hi>Innerneſs,</hi> without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honour or profit, gave Major General <hi>Middleton</hi> time to raiſe ſix hundred Horſe and eight hundred Foot to raiſe
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:116025:249"/>the Siege, and notwithſtanding <hi>Huntley</hi> had notice thereof by <hi>Montroſs,</hi> yet could he receive no anſwer from him but what reliſht of ſcornfulneſs; nay ſo far off were they from affording him aſſiſtance, that <hi>Montroſs</hi> having ſent three Troops of Horſe to lie at the Fords of the <hi>Spey,</hi> to obſerve the motion of the enemy, and if they came, to ſend him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and certain intelligence; <hi>Lewes Gordon, Huntleys</hi> Son, who then commanded the Caſtle of <hi>Rothes,</hi> invited the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to a banquet in his Caſtle, perſwading them to leave off their needleſs guards, and that the enemy lay very far off, where with dainty chear and ſtore of wine he detained them ſo long till <hi>Middleton</hi> with a great Army of Horſe and Foot had got over the <hi>Spey,</hi> and ſet footing in <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey;</hi> ſo that had not <hi>Montroſs</hi> had notice of their approach another way, he had had a ſharper bout now then he had at <hi>Selkirk;</hi> but <hi>Montroſs</hi> knowing them too ſtrong for him in Horſe, avoyding the plain, he retreated with his men beyond the <hi>Neſs;</hi> and notwithſtanding their often falling upon his rear, yet he ſo well managed his retreat, that with little loſs he advanced unto the Bank of the <hi>Spey,</hi> ſafe from his enemies Horſe.</p>
               <p>And now he reſolved without further delay to make his progreſs over all the North Countrey and Highlands, with a conſiderable party, to liſt Souldiers, to encourage the well diſpoſed, to reduce thoſe that were refractory by the ſeverity of the Laws and condigne puniſhment, and to deal with them as men uſe to do with ſick children, make them to take Phyſick whether they will or no; but whileſt he was buſie about his deſign, there came a Herald unto him from the King (who by I know not what misfortune had caſt himſelf upon the Scotch Covenanters at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>) whereby he was required forthwith to lay down his Arms and disband, and to depart into <hi>France,</hi> and there to wait his Majeſties further pleaſure; he being aſtoniſhed with this unexpected meſſage, bitterly bewailed the ſad condition of
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:116025:249"/>the King, that had forced him to caſt himſelf upon the mercy of his deadly enemies; yet not to be guilty of that crime, and eſpecially leſt the Covenanters ſhould put his actions upon the Kings account, and uſe him the worſe for them, ſeeing they had him in their power, he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Kings command disbanded his Army.</p>
               <p>Now it was articled betwixt the King and the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſhould depart <hi>Scotland</hi> within a moneth, and that they ſhould finde him Shiping, with proviſion and all things neceſſary when he went; but they ſeeking to circumvent him, ſent him no Ship for his tranſportation until the laſt day allowed for his ſtay: the Ship it ſelf ill vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualled and worſe rig'd, ſo that when <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſhewed himſelf ready to depart, the Maſter of the Ship told him, that he muſt have ſome dayes allowed him to pitch and righ is Ship, before he durſt adventure himſelf to the winde and waves: moreover there lay great Engliſh Ships and Men of War every day in ſight about the mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Esk</hi> (by which he was to paſs) attending there in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Covenanters, for their much deſired booty, that by no means he might eſcape their hands.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſmelling out their deſigns, had ſent ſome before hand to ſearch diligently the Havens in the North; who by good fortune in the Haven of <hi>Stanhyve</hi> found a ſmall bark of <hi>Bargen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> the maſter whereof was ſoon agreed with; thither <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſent ſeveral of his friends whom he knew could not be ſafe for never ſo little a while in that Countrey, and they on the third of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1646. having a good winde put forth to Sea for <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> and the ſame evening <hi>Montroſs</hi> himſelf, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely with one <hi>James Wood,</hi> a worthy Preacher, by a ſmall Cock-boat got into a Bark which lay at Anchor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Haven of <hi>Montroſs,</hi> and being clad in a courſe ſuit, the Lord and Patron paſſed for his Chaplains ſervant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſs</hi> having thus cleared himſelf out of his enemies
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:116025:250"/>hands, went into <hi>France,</hi> where by the general conſent of the Princes of the Blood, and the reſt of the Nobility, he was deſign'd Captain General of all the ſtrangers in that Kingdom, a place of great honour and truſt; but Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Mazarine</hi> thwarting his deſigns, (being a profeſſed foe to Scots in that Kingdom) he took his journey into <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Prince then was, in purſuit of his former intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> (a name fatal to the Houſe of the <hi>Stewards</hi>) who formerly was his irreconcilable enemy was now his competitor; ſo that <hi>Montroſs</hi> ſeeing no good there to be done, travel'd up into <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Auſtria,</hi> where by the Emperour he was curteouſly entertained, and amongſt many other honours conferred on him, he freely proffered him the command of ten thouſand men for a ſtanding Army againſt the Swede: but peace being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt theſe two Potentates (intending a journey for <hi>Scotland</hi>) being honourably diſmiſſed, he addreſſes himſelf to the Dukes of <hi>Brandeburgh</hi> and <hi>Holſteyn,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gathered together about ſix or ſeven hundred men, fearing he ſhould have an expreſs command to deſiſt from his purpoſe, becauſe the Treaty betwixt the Prince and the Scottiſh Commiſſioners was now very near a concluſion, made him precipitate himſelf and thoſe that were with him into moſt inevitable ruine; for conſidering his ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, it was a deſperate action to attempt ſo mighty a buſineſs, but the matter being fatal, he muſt needs contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his own endeavours towards that deſtruction which his cruel fortune had provided for him. Nor could the loſs of two Ships with all the men and arms therein, (whom he had ſent before to prepare his way) alter his reſolution, but with the reſt of his company paſſes over to <hi>Orkney,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving raiſed what force he could there, embarcks himſelf, and in a ſhort ſpace lands upon the point of <hi>Cathnes,</hi> which is the fartheſt land to the Northweſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as knowing the world was much aſtoniſht at this invaſion; now whileſt
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:116025:250"/>the King was upon a Treaty, he publiſhed a Declaration, wherein he laboured to clear himſelf of any aſperſion of ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ends; that his intention was onely againſt ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, who had againſt the Laws of the Kingdom, raiſed and maintained a War againſt the Kings Father, and did now by their ſubtil practices endeavour to deſtroy the Son alſo; but the Countrey for ſeveral cauſes did not come to ſecond him as he expected; ſo that being encountred by the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> and Collonel <hi>Staughorn,</hi> his Army was overthrown, two hundred killed, and twelve hundred taken. In this skirmiſh was taken the Standard which he had cauſed to be made of purpoſe to move the affections of the people, with this Motto, <hi>Judge and revenge my cauſe, O Lord,</hi> and the Portraict of the late King beheaded, exactly well done. The Standard-bearer a very gallant young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was killed, after he had ſeveral times refuſed quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; there was Collonel <hi>Hurry</hi> taken, the Lord <hi>Frenderick,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalgety,</hi> Collonel <hi>Hay</hi> of <hi>Naughton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Grya,</hi> and moſt of the Officers, and two Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montroſs</hi> himſelf after he ſaw the day was abſolutely loſt, having with his Sword hewn out his way through the midſt of his enemies, hoping fortune might afterward be more favourable to him, he endeavours by policy to ſave his life, and forſaking his Horſe, throws away his Cloak and Sword, then exchanging apparrel with a Highlander, in that habit keeps himſelf undiſcovered in the Fields for three or four dayes together; but ſuch narrow ſearch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for him, that he could not long eſcape, he freely diſcovers himſelf to the Lord of <hi>Aſtron,</hi> who had been one of his followers before, thinking to finde friendſhip at his hands; but he greedy of the reward which was promiſed to his apprehender by the Council of State, money having a deeper impreſſion in his heart then amity, ſeized on him, and with a ſtrong guard conveyed him to <hi>David Leſley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He being now in the cuſtody of his mortal enemies, from
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:116025:251"/>whom he could not expect the leaſt favour, he yet expreſt a ſingular conſtancy, and in a manner a careleſneſs of his own condition. And now joyful of their prey, they conduct him to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where by the way lodging one night at the Town of <hi>Dundee,</hi> notwithſtanding they had ſuffered more by his Army then any Town elſe within that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet were they ſo far from inſulting over him, that they teſtified a great deal of ſorrow for his woful condition, and furniſhed him with cloathes ſuitable to his birth and perſon. The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> being otherwiſe affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who was then informed of his taking, thought fit to give out this Sentence againſt him before he came to <hi>Edenburgh; That ſo ſoon as he ſhould come to Town, he ſhould be met at the Gate by the Magiſtrates, and Hangman; that he ſhould be tyed with cords upon a Cart bare-headed, and the Hangman to ride upon the Horſe that drew the Cart, covered before him, amd ſo to be brought though the Town; that he ſhould be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Gibbet at the Croſs of</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>until he dyed; his Hiſtory and Declaration hanging about his neck, and ſo hang three hours in publick view of all the people: after wich, he ſhould be beheaded and quartered. His head to be fixt upon the priſon-houſe of</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>and his Legs and Arms over the Gates of the Cities of</hi> Sterling, Glaſcow, St. Johns Town, <hi>and</hi> Aberdeen. All which was executed upon him with a great deal of inſultation, eſpecially of the Miniſtery, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him now at their mercy could never be ſatisfied with his calamities; they reviled him with all poſſible ſpite, obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted frequently to him his former condition, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſery, and pronounced heavy judgements againſt him; and being asked why they could not otherwiſe be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but by ſo ignominious handling of him? they reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>They knew no other way to humble him, and bring him home to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fatal day being come deſign'd to put a period to all his troubles, there was erected in the middle of the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:116025:251"/>a large Scaffold, breſt high, in the midſt of which, was planted a Gibbet of extraordinary height; to this place was he conducted by the Baliffs, he was cloathed in a Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Cloak richly laced with Gold lace; as he came along the Streets in great State, there appeared in his countenance ſo much Beauty, Majeſty, and Gravity, as amazed the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>John Taylors</hi> honeſt Verſes will ſerve for this diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Scotch expedtion.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Being come thither, he was much detained with a great many frivolous queſtions, of which, partly the Miniſters, partly thoſe whom the States ſuffered to be about him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be ſatisfied. He made a ſhort Speech, in which he was often interrupted; the tenour of which was, <hi>That be was ſatisfied in his conſcience for what he had done for his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Maſter the King, as in relation to War. That for his own particular ſins (which were infinite) he bad beg'd pardon ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly of God, and had an inward hope to obtain it; he freely forgave all thoſe who had ſought his overthrow, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the charity of all the people to pray both for him and themſelves.</hi> The Miniſters becauſe he was under the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication refuſed to pray for him, and even on the very Scaffold were very bitter againſt him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had about a quarter of an hour prayed with his Hat before his eyes, he was ready to go to his ſuffering, when his Book, and Declaration, and all other printed Papers which he had publiſhed in his life, being tyed in a ſtring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, were hanged a bout his neck; he was very earneſt that he might have the liberty to keep on his hat, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed; he requeſted he might have the priviledge to keep his Cloak about him, neither would that be granted; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of all their affronts, uncivil, and barbarous uſage, with a moſt undaunted courage he went up to the top of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Gibbet; where having freely pardoned the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:116025:252"/>he gave him three or four pieces of gold; when this was done, and his arms tied, he asked the Officers, <hi>If they had any more diſhonour, as they conceived it, to put upon him, he was ready to accept it.</hi> Then commanding the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at the uplifting of his hands to tumble him over; he was accordingly thruſt off by the weeping Executioner, who with his more honeſt tears ſeemed to revile the cruelty of his Countrey men.

               </head>
               <p>The Countrey of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath from old brought forth ſo many pious and learned men, that ſeveral Writers have termed it, <hi>The Land of Sains.</hi> Amongſt the reſt this worthy Prelate is not the leaſt Ornament unto that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; one who was a perſon of great Piety, of ſingular Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, learned to a miracle; ſo excelling in knowledge, both Humane and Divine, that I cannot write ſo high of his worth, as his merits raiſed themſelves above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>He was born at <hi>Dublyn,</hi> in the Year of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1580. extracted from honeſt and able Parents; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was one of the Clerks of the Chancery, a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts and endowments. His Mother of the Family of the <hi>Stanihurſts,</hi> ſufficiently famous in <hi>Richard Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt, Irelands Cambden,</hi> the moſt eminent Philoſopher of his time. This his good, though ſeduced Mother through the ſubtilty of the Popiſh Prieſts was drawn into the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Perſwaſion, and notwithſtanding great means was uſed for the reclaiming her, yet continued ſhe therein to the day of her death. His Grandfather by his Mothers ſide was choſen three times Speaker of the Houſe of Commons in Parliament in <hi>Ireland.</hi> His Uncle by his Fathers ſide was one of his Predeceſſors Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh.</hi> And as he was thus nobly deſcended, ſo was he as well educated; being at eight years old ſent to the Grammar School, Sir <hi>James Fullerton</hi> being his School-maſter, and Sir. <hi>James Hamilton</hi> (afterwards Lord Viſcount <hi>Clandeboiſe</hi>) Uſher to the School, who were by King <hi>James</hi> ſent out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon another deſign, but diſguized themſelves under
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:116025:253"/>that employment. Under theſe two he ſo profited, that in four years time he excelled in Grammar, Rhetorick and Poeſie; and was ſo affected with Chronology and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that in his early years he drew out an exact <hi>Series of Times</hi> when each eminent perſon lived.</p>
               <p>The next year, being the thirteenth of his age, he was admitted into the Colledge of <hi>Dublyn,</hi> being the firſt Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that was entered into it: and truly it is a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Colledge received more Honour thereby, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo learned a man recorded in the Frontiſpiece of their Admiſſion Book; or the from the Colledge in honouring him to be their firſt Graduate, Fellow, Procter, &amp;c. At the ſame time alſo Sir <hi>James Hamilton</hi> hitherto Uſher of the School, was choſen Fellow of the Colledge, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Tutour under whom he attained to a perfection in the Greek and Hebrew Languages, which he wanted when he came to the Colledge.</p>
               <p>He thus increaſing in knowledge as in years, looked ſtill further, as he did account all knowledge vain which tended not to the eſtabliſhment of his minde, and to the good of his future eſtate. For the furtherance of this Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he read many Books, amongſt other that of <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Fortreſs of the Faith,</hi> wherein he blotteth our Church with Novelty, in diſſenting from them, who from all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity had maintained the ſame Faith; this plunged our great Schollar into ſeveral doubts, that the ancienteſt muſt needs be the beſt, as the nearer the Fountain the purer the ſtreams; and that Errors were received in ſucceeding Ages, according to that known ſpeech of <hi>Tertullian, Verum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque primum, adulterum quodcunque poſterius.</hi> For the rectifying of his judgement herein, with indefatigable pains and induſtry, he read over moſt of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and moſt Authors writing of the Body of Divinity; whereby he not onely ſettled his Opinion, but alſo became able to diſpute with the prime of the adverſe party.</p>

               <p>Soon after was he choſen Catechiſt of the Colledge, and immediately after (notwithſtanding he was not-twenty one years of age) he was ordained <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and afterwards proved mighty powerful in his preaching, converting many Papiſts to the Proteſtant Religion; who came ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear him, and ſo admired his Doctrine, that it was well hoped the Nation would be <hi>of one heart and one minde;</hi> but through the connivance of ſome in Authority, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes made againſt Papiſts were ſuſpended, and they obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little leſs then a tolleraton in their Religion; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many of them to withdraw themſelves again. This pious Biſhop entertaining an holy Indignation thereat, preached a Sermon to the State at <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn,</hi> taking for his Text this paſſage in <hi>Ezekiel, Chap.</hi> 4.6. where the Prophet <hi>by lying on his ſide was to bear the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> Judah <hi>forty dayes. I have appointed thee day for a
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:116025:254"/>year, even a day for a year,</hi> (as the Old Tranſlation of that Bible he then uſed reads it) making this application thereof, <hi>From this year will I reckon the ſin of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that thoſe whom you now embrace ſhall be your ruine, and you ſhall bear this iniquity.</hi> Now this paſſage of the Prophet doth by conſent of Interpreters ſignifie the time of forty years to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that Nation for their Idolatry; and this Sermon being Preached in <hi>Anno</hi> 1601. juſt forty years before that horrid Rebellion brake forth in <hi>Ireland, Anno</hi> 1641. made it appear that it had ſomething in it of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick ſpirit.</p>
               <p>His firſt Church preferment was to the Chancellourſhip of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> in which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> found him, <hi>An.</hi> 1607. at what time he was compoſing his moſt excellent <hi>Brittania,</hi> of whom he gives this Character in his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning <hi>Dublin. Moſt of which I acknowledge to owe to the diligence and labour of</hi> James Uſher, <hi>Chancellour of the Church of Saint</hi> Patrick, <hi>who in various learning and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment far exceeds his years.</hi> Soon after Mr. <hi>Cambdens</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be commenc'd <hi>Batchellor of Divinity,</hi> and immediately upon it was choſen Profeſſor of Divinity in that Univerſity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> which he held about thirteen or fourteen years; during which time the Provoſtſhip of the Colledge falling void, he was unanimouſly elected by the Fellows; but by reaſon of ſome trouble belonging to it (notwithſtanding it it had a large annual allowance) he refuſed it: a thing to be taken notice of, becauſe rare amongſt the Cleargy men of this latter age.</p>
               <p>Soon after he proceeded <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> and now his eminency gained him enemies, who ſcandalized him to King <hi>James,</hi> under the notion of a Puritan; but what was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his downfal proved for his preferment; for the King entring into a free diſcourſe with him, received from him ſuch abundant ſatisfaction of the ſoundneſs of his Judgement and Piety, that notwithſtanding the oppoſition
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:116025:254"/>of great ones, without his ſeeking, made him Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> juſt then falling void whileſt he was in <hi>England;</hi> upon his entering into his dignity, a Wit of thoſe times made this excellent Annagram upon him.</p>
               <q>James Meath,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anagrama,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>I am the ſame.</q>
               <p>Which he made good ever after in the whole courſe of his life, neither being puffed up with the the windy titles of ambition, nor ſlacking his former conſtancy of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; engraving this Motto on his Epiſcopal Seal, <hi>Vae mihi ſi non Evangeliza vero,</hi> which he continued in the Seal of his Primacy alſo. It is credibly reported of him that he was perſon of ſo excellent a memory, that when he hath bin diſtant from his Library many miles, without the aid of any Catalogue, he hath directed his man by the figures of them imprinted in his minde, to go directly to the ſeveral places where they ſtood, to bring him ſuch Books as he wanted.</p>
               <p>During the time he was Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> he anſwered that <hi>Challenge of the Jeſuite Malone;</hi> and coming over into <hi>England</hi> to have it Printed, during his abode here, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Hampton</hi> dying, he was made Primate of <hi>Ireland, An.</hi> 1624. And now though he was promoted to the higheſt ſtep his profeſſion was capable of in his native Countrey, yet having ſome occaſion of ſtay ſtill in <hi>England,</hi> he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his laborious preaching in a little Village called <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> where upon the requeſt of ſome Miniſters of that County to preach on the Week dayes, (becauſe they could not come to hear him on the Sundayes) preaching too often beyond his ſtrength, he fell into a Quartane Ague, which held him three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had he recovered his ſickneſs, when it pleaſed God to make him the inſtrument of the converſion of an honourable perſon to the Proteſtant Religion, the occaſion thus; the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Peterborough</hi>)

The fourth day according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Jeſuite was to have been opponent, but that morning he excuſed himſelf to the Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That all the Arguments he uſed, he had framed within his own head, and thought he had them as perfect as his</hi> Pater Noſter, <hi>but he had ſtrangely forgotten, and could not recover them again;</hi> which cauſed him to ſay, <hi>That he believed it was the juſt judgement of God upon him, thus to deſert him in the defence of his cauſe for the undertaking of himſelf to diſpute with a man of that eminency and learning, without the licence of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.</hi> This excuſe gave ſo little ſatisfaction to the Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> that upon ſome further conference with the Archbiſhop, he became a Proteſtant, and ſo continued to his dying day. After this Victory over the Jeſuit, with the Canon bullets of his controverſial Pen, he diſperſt whole Armie of the Iriſh Catholicks, ſo that they were never able to rally their Forces again.</p>
               <p>After ſome time of tarrying in <hi>England,</hi> he returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was received with great acclamations of joy: where he continued faithfully diſcharging his Office, until the year before the Rebellion brake forth there, in which he returned into <hi>England;</hi> not long after was the
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:116025:256"/>great buſineſs of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> in agitation. I have heard it reported by men not over credulous to believe flying news, that the day before the King ſigned the Bill for that Earls death, that when the King for the ſatisfying of his conſcience deſired the opinion of him, as alſo of the Biſhops of <hi>London, Durham, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Carliſle;</hi> that thoſe other four for the ſatisfying of the people, (who were then grown extraordinary inſolent) wiſhed him to ſign the Bill. But that this Biſhop adviſed the King not to wound his Conſcience, in ſeeking to heal State ſores; the truth of this I will not aſſert, for it is confidently believed by many, that Doctor <hi>Juxon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was not aſſenting thereto; but this is certain, that when a perſon of honour had in the Kings preſence, ſpoken words in effect that this Biſhop ſhould adviſe him to the ſigning of that Bill, that he in very great paſſion, (laying his hand upon his breaſt) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted his innocency therein. It is generally reported, how true I know not, that when the King heard that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Lady had extended her nobleneſs to the Biſhop, that he ſhould ſay, <hi>That that charity of hers would cover a multitude of her ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many endeavours, not like the fire-drakes of our late Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, did this reverend Biſhop uſe to draw the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to a Reconciliation; and ſo faithfully diſcharged he hid endeavours, that he won the love of both ſides. Thus after he had holily and peaceably for many years to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and edification of his Church, continued to the time of his death conſtantly preaching the word of God, he in the ſeventy ſixth year of his age ſurrendered up his ſoul into the hands of his Maker; his mamory being as a precious Oyntment yielding a ſweet ſavour in the Noſtrils of Gods Saints, which gave occaſion to one of our late Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets amongſt many others, to write theſe two Verſes.</p>

               <p>But to come to his Life, he was Son to <hi>Richard Lilburne</hi> of the County of <hi>Durham;</hi> during his miniority an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice in <hi>London,</hi> near <hi>London-ſtone,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Hewſon,</hi> a

               <p>It happened during the impriſonment of Doctor <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> (cenſured for libelling by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>) divers perſons affecting the ſaid Doctor, out of their love reſorting to him; amongſt the reſt, one of them took <hi>John Lilburne</hi> with him as his aſſociate: after plenty of chear Doctor <hi>Baſtwick</hi> to ſolace his gueſts, read to them his Lettany, which he had written againſt the Prelates, which Book was highly pleaſing to them all. <hi>Lilburne</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hearing the ſaid Lettany read, and knowing that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was written in defiance of that power, then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hated, would be very acceptable; he deſired of Doctor <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> to have a copy of one of them, with which he would travel beyond Sea, and cauſe it to be printed, not doubting to be enriched by it; the winde of this fancy tranſported him over Sea, accompanied with a fellow whoſe fidelity he doubted not; there he printed many Books, and by them got much money, ſelling them even at what rates he pleaſed; afterwards coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> bringing with him his printed trinkets, hoping to have a new Mart, the fellow that accompanied him was his betrayer, who gave information to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>

               <p>But the times altering, the Biſhops being Voted down by Parliament, and a War enſuing betwixt them and the King, theſe his ſufferings cauſed him to be looked upon by the Parliament, who preferred him to the Office of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonel in their Army; wherein he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt gallantly, particularly at <hi>Brainford;</hi> where he with about 700. men withſtood the Kings whole Army, about five hours together, and fought it out to the very Swords point, and to the Butt end of the Musket, and thereby hindred the King from his then poſſeſſing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Train of Artillery, and by conſequence the City of <hi>London;</hi> in which act he was taken priſoner, without Articles or capitulation, and was by the King and his Party then lookt upon, as one of the moſt active men in the whole company; and ſhould have been therefore Tryed for his life had not he by his wit avoyded the ſame by ſending to the Parliament, who thereupon ſent a Letter to <hi>Oxford,</hi> threatning them with <hi>lex talionis,</hi> (they having at the ſame time many of their great eminent men priſoners in the <hi>Tower, Warwick Caſtle,</hi> and other places) which put a period to all further proceedings againſt him, and freed him by an exchange.</p>
               <p>Returning to <hi>London,</hi> he begins to ſet abroach his facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions, writing a Pamphlet, wherein he termed the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:116025:260"/>Laws, Norman innovations, with other unparallel'd ſpeeches; all which he ſent to Judge <hi>Reeve,</hi> who himſelf, or ſome other for him, made a complaint unto the Lords, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſummoned him to appear before them, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did; where being commanded to kneel at the Bar, he refuſed, ſaying. <hi>That he had learned both better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and manners, then to kneel to any humane, or mortal power how great ſoever:</hi> with many other aggravating and ambitious ſpeeches, which committed him cloſe priſoner, firſt to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he continued above twelve moneths together; but this not a whit calmed his ſpirit, but was rather like Oyl caſt on the fire, finding occaſion from theſe his troubles and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to enveigh more bitterly againſt the Government and Governours then in being, terming the Parliament (to uſe his own words in his ſcurrulous pamphlets,) <hi>A pack of diſſembling juggling knaves, a company of tyrants, the moſt perfidious, falſe, faith and truſt-breakers, that ever lived in the world, and ought by all rational men to be moſt deteſted of all men that breathe; treacherous, ſelf-ſeeking, uſurpers of the name and power of a Parliament, moſt treacherouſly to do what they liſt. Saying, That</hi> Corah, Dathan, <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more againſt Authority, as the General,</hi> (viz. <hi>the Lord</hi> Fairfax) <hi>and his Councel; nor the Anabaptiſts at</hi> Munſter, <hi>with</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Leidon, <hi>and</hi> Knipperdolling, <hi>were never more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of Authority, nor</hi> Jack Straw <hi>and</hi> Wat Tyler, <hi>nor all thoſe famous men mentioned with a black pen in our Hiſtories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe, with infinite other railing tearms his pamphlets are ſtuffed and farced withal, not fit to be beſtowed on the moſt inveterate enemies can be encountred in this Life; the young Gentleman was very prodigal of ſuch <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as his impudence was moſt conducing to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate deſigns, &amp;c. For theſe, and many other ſingle ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired expreſſions of the nature, contained in ſeveral Books which he wrote, he was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and by a
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:116025:260"/>ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> tryed upon a Charge of High Treaſon at the <hi>Guild Hall</hi> in <hi>London; Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 24, 25. 26. 1649. Many were the Commiſſioners that ſat upon his Tryal, and multitudes of Spectators that came to behold it.</p>
               <p>I have inſerted his Tryal thus at large, not onely as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the eminency of it, but as many paſſages in it from his own lips, give further illuſtrations of his Life.</p>

                     <p>The Lieutenant of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> Collonel <hi>Francis Weſt</hi> was called, to bring forth his Priſoner accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the precept.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon Collonel <hi>Weſt</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower, brought up the Priſoner out of the Iriſh Chamber, where he had been ſome time before the ſitting of the Court, and was guarded by the ſaid Lieutenant, and a ſpecial Guard of Souldiers beſides. And being brought to the Bar, the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> were directed to take the Priſoner into their cuſtody.</p>
                     <p>Silence commanded, the Crier ſaid, <hi>John Lilburne, hold up thy hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Lilburne</hi> directed himſelf to Maſter <hi>Keble</hi> one of the Keepers of the great Seal, as the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Court, and ſaid to this purpoſe, Sir, will it pleaſe you to hear me, and if ſo, by your favour thus. All the priviledge for my part that I ſhall crave this day at your hands is no more, but that which is properly and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Liberty of every Free-born Engliſh-man, <hi>viz.</hi> the benefit of the Laws and Liberties thereof, which by my Birth-right and Inheritance is due unto me; the which I have fought for as well as others have done, with a ſingle and upright heart; and if I cannot have and enjoy this, I ſhall leave this Teſtimony behinde me, that I died for the Laws and Liberties of this Nation: and upon this ſcore I ſtand, and if I periſh I periſh. And if the Fact that I have done cannot be juſtified by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> let me pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. I mention none of this for the gaining of mercy, or by way of merit, no I ſcorn it; for mercy I crave from none but from the hands of my God alone, with whom I hope, and am aſſured one day to reſt; whom I have ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my eyes, and ſo walked, as believing I am alwayes in his preſence, in whoſe power my confidence is fixed, whom I take and own to be my ſtay, my ſtaff, my ſtrength and ſupport, and in whom I reſt as the life of my life, and whom
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:116025:261"/>I hope to meet with joy, when this fading and uncertain life ſhall have an end, to live with him in glory, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs for evermore. And becauſe I would not willingly trouble you with many words, to cauſe you to ſpend your time impertinently; therefore Sir, in reference to the Court, I ſhall crave but ſo much liberty from you as was given to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he pleaded for his life before the Heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Judges, which was free liberty of ſpeech to ſpeak for himſelf, the which I now humbly crave as my right, not onely by the Law of God and Man, but alſo by the law and light of Nature: And I ſhall do it with that reſpect, reaſon, and judgement, that doth become a man that knows what it is to plead for his life. I hope Gode hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me ability to be maſter of my own paſſion, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with that reaſon, that will dictate unto me what is for my own good and benefit.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeveral times been arraigned for my life already. I was once arraigned before the Houſe of Peers for (ſticking cloſe to the Liberties and Priviledges of this Nation, and thoſe that ſtood for them) being one of thoſe two or three me, that firſt drew their ſwords in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> againſt Collonel <hi>Lunsford,</hi> and ſome ſcores of his aſſociates. At that time, it was ſuppoſed, they intended to cut the throats of the chiefeſt men then ſitting in the Houſe of Commons; I ſay for this, and other things of the like nature, I was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned by the Kings ſpecial Command and Order, the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1641. I mention it to this end, that when I came before the Houſe of Peers, where was about three or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Lords then ſitting at the beginning of the parliament; (who then were ſuppoſed the moſt arbitrary of any power in <hi>England</hi>) yet I had from them free liberty of ſpeech, to ſpeak for my life at their Bar, without check or controll in the beſt manner, that all thoſe abilities God had given me would enable me; and when I was at <hi>Oxford.</hi> I was again arraigned as a Traytor before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Heath,</hi>
                        <pb n="486" facs="tcp:116025:262"/>for levying War at the Command of the then Parliament againſt the perſon of the King: and when I came before him in the <hi>Guild Hall of Oxford,</hi> he told me (there being preſent with him as his fellow Judge) Maſter <hi>Gardiner,</hi> (ſometimes Recorder of the City of <hi>London</hi>) now Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gardiner,</hi> and others that ſate by a ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> from the King; the which Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I did not ſo well then underſtand, as I hope I do now. And my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Heath</hi> ſtood up, and in the face of all the Court, and in the face of all the Countrey preſent there told me, Captain <hi>Lilburne,</hi> you are brought here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us for High Treaſon, for leavying War in <hi>Oxfordſhire</hi> againſt your Sovereign Lord and King; and though you be now in a Garriſon, and were taken in Arms in open hoſtility againſt the King. (yea Sir, and I muſt now tell you in ſuch hoſtility, that we were but about ſeven hundred men at <hi>Brandford</hi> that withſtood the Kings whole Army in the field, about five hours together, and fought it out to the very ſwords point, and to the butt end of the Musket; and thereby hindered the King from his then poſſeſſing the Parliaments Train of Artillery, and by conſequence the City of <hi>London;</hi> in which very act I was taken a Priſoner, without Articles or Capitulation, and was by the King and his Party then lookt upon, as one of the activeſt men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in the whole company) yet ſaid Judge <hi>Heath,</hi> we will not take advantage of that, to try you by the rules of Arbitrary Marſhal Law, or any other Arbitrary wayes; but we will try you by the rules of the good old Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and whatſoever priviledge in your Tryal the Laws of <hi>England</hi> will afford you, claim it as your Birth-right and Inheritance, and you ſhall enjoy it with as much freedom and willingneſs, as if you were in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> to be tryed amongſt your own Party; and this we will do for that end, that ſo at <hi>London</hi> your friends ſhall not have any juſt cauſe to ſay, we murthered you with cruelty, or
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:116025:262"/>denied you the benefit of the Law, in taking away your life by the rules of our own wills. Nay, further ſaid he, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Lilburne,</hi> it is true, I am a Judge made by my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord the King, according to his right by Law, and ſo in a ſpecial manner am his Servant and Councellour, and am to act for his good, benefit, and advantage: And yet notwithſtanding it is by the known Laws of this Land my duty to be indifferent and free from partiallity betwixt my Maſter and you the Priſoner, and I am ſpecially bound unto it alſo by my Oath; and therefore you ſhall have the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt priviledges of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which is a Law of Mercy. and not of Rigour, and hath the life of a man in tendereſt and higheſt eſtimation; and therefore it is the duty of a Judge by Law to be of counſel with the Priſoner, in things wherein by his ignorance he falls ſhort of making uſe of the benefit of the Law, eſpecially when he is upon the Tryal of his life. Yea, and to exhort him to anſwer without fear, if he perceive him daunted or amazed at the preſence of the Court: Yea, it is my duty to carry my ſelf with all fairneſs and evenneſs of hand towards you; and wherein that there ſhall ſeem any miſtakes to appear in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Formalities, to rectifie you: For 'tis my duty to help you, and not to uſe any boiſterous or rough language to you in the leaſt, to put you in fear, or any wayes prevent the freedom of you defence: and according to the Laws of <hi>England</hi> this is my duty, and this is the Law. And accordingly he gave me liberty to plead to the errors of my Indictment, before ever I pleaded not guilty; yea, and alſo became willing to aſſign me what Councel I pleaſed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, freely to come to priſon to me, and to conſult and adviſe with me, and help me in point of Law: This laſt he did immediately upon my pleading to the Indictment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Fact was proved, all which is conſonant to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Judgement of Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> that great Oracle of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Books are publiſhed by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:116025:263"/>Orders and Authority of Parliament for good Law, who in his 3. <hi>part Inſtitutes, Chapt. Of High Treaſon,</hi> fol. 29.34. compared with <hi>fol.</hi> 137.230. aſſerts the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Truly, Sir, I being now come before you to anſwer for my life, and being no profeſſed Lawyer, may through my own ignorance of the practick part of the Law, eſpecially in the Formalities, Niſities and Puntillio's thereof, run my ſelf with over-much haſtineſs, in ſnares and dangers that I ſhall not eaſily get out of. And therefore being all of a ſudden bid to hold up my hand at the Bar, I cannot chuſe but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle demur upon it, and yet with all reſpect to you, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my deſirableneſs to keep within the bounds of Reaſon, Moderation and Diſcretion, and ſo to carry my ſelf as it doth become a man that knows what it is to anſwer for his life.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in the firſt place, I have ſomething to ſay to the Court about the firſt Fundamental liberty of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man in order to his Tryal, which is, that by the Laws of this Land, all Courts of Juſtice alwayes ought to be free and open for all ſorts of peaceable people to ſee, behold, and hear, and have free acceſs unto; and no man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ought to be tryed in holes or corners, or in any place where the Gates are ſhut and bar'd, and guarded with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men: and yet, Sir, as I came in, I found the Gates ſhut and guarded; which is contrary both to Law and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Sir, the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and the Priviledges thereof, are my Inheritance and Birth-right: And, Sir, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that I was ſometimes ſummoned before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Parliament, where Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> and ſeveral others have had the Chair; and there I ſtood upon my right by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and refuſed to proceed with the ſaid Committee, till by ſpecial order they cauſed their Doors to be wide thrown open, that the people might have free and uninterrupted acceſs to hear, ſee, and conſider of what
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:116025:263"/>they ſaid to me; although I think the pretence that I am now brought before you for, be the very ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that I was convened before Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> for, which was about Books; and I am ſure there I did argue the caſe with him and the reſt of the Committee ſoundly out in Law, proving that they were bound in Law and Juſtice, freely to open their Doors, for the free acceſs of all ſorts and kindes of Auditors: And I did refuſe (as of right) to proceed with them, till by ſpecial order they did open their Doors. For no tryal in ſuch caſes, ought to be in any place, unleſs it be publick, open and free; and therefore if you pleaſe that I may enjoy that Legal Right and Priviledge which was granted unto me by Mr. <hi>Miles Corbet,</hi> and the reſt of that Committee, (when I was brought before them in the like caſe that now I am brought before you:) which priviledge I know to be my right by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall, as it becomes an underſtanding Engliſhman, (who in his actions hates deeds of darkneſs, holes or corners) go on to a tryal. But if I be denyed this undoubted priviledge, I ſhall rather dye here then proceed any further. And therefore foreſeeing this beforehand, and being willing to provide againſt all jealouſies of my eſcape, the fear of which I ſuppoſed might be objected againſt me as a ground to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me this my legal right; and therefore beforehand I have given my engagement to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> that I will be a faithful and true priſoner to him.</p>
                     <p>He enlarged himſelf as to other particulars, but theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt material as to the relation of ſome paſſages of his Life, I thought it neceſſary to inſert them. He having theſe requeſted freedoms granted him from Judge <hi>Keble,</hi> his tryal went on, which becauſe of it ſelf it is a large print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed volume, I ſhall onely hint at ſome things not to be omitted in it.</p>
                     <p>After he had ended his Speech, Judge <hi>Keble</hi> told him that his requeſts were granted, bid him look behinde him,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:116025:264"/>the Doors were open. Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> the Atturney General excepted againſt the favour done him of the liberty of his Speech, as at the beginning of his arraignment he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to hold up his hand; he further expreſſed that the Commiſſion for the Tryal of Mr. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> was for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt the State and him. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired that Maſter <hi>Prideaux</hi> might be excepted againſt as his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, one of the faction of the Court againſt his life. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> told him that he ſpoke irrationally and indiſcreetly; he having ſo fair reſpect and ſo free a hearing to except againſt ſo great a Miniſter of the Court; afterwards Judge <hi>Jermyn</hi> a ſound Lawyer, but a better forenoon then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons man, ſaid, That ſince Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> begun to plant his Ordnance againſt the Authority of the Court, that the Court did ſit by a lawful Authority derived from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the ſupreme Authority of <hi>England,</hi> that he was accuſed of High Treaſon, had his Jury of Freemen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Citizens, men of religious integrity; he inſtanced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes to him, concluding, that he deſired him to put himſelf upon his Tryal by Law, and to hear with patience thoſe offences of Treaſon were laid to his charge. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> notwithſtanding continued to uſe ſeveral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> which he knew to be that, by the virtue of which they did ſit; and ſince he was to be tryed for his life, he deſired to hear their Commiſſion read; but ſince they had denyed him that, he deſired all his friends to take notice how contrary to reaſon and equity they dealt with him. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> urged him ſtill, not taking notice of his Traverſes, to hold up his hand at the Bar, which he explained to him was no more but a ſpecial notice that the party is the man inquired for, and therefore if he were <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> the man that was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he bid him but ſay that he was the man, and that he was there, and that ſhould ſuffice. <hi>Lilburne</hi> accordingly ſaid, <hi>I am</hi> John Lilburne, <hi>Son to</hi> John Lilburne. Judge <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn</hi>
                        <pb n="491" facs="tcp:116025:264"/>afterwards to perſwade him to hold up his hand, gave him two reaſons why that cuſtom had been alwayes uſed. Firſt, for notice that thoſe who are called for capital and criminal offences, that they ſhould hold up the hand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they are the men. Secondly, he ſaid, that a pure innocent hand did ſet forth a clear and unſpotted heart, for which reaſon he bid Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> hold up his hand; if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do it, he deprived himſelf of the prime benefit of the cuſtoms of <hi>England.</hi> Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſtill quibling with the Court and refuſing, Judge <hi>Keble</hi> gave order that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment ſhould be read, to which purpoſe Maſter <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> read, <hi>Hold up your hand Maſter</hi> Lilburne, <hi>and hearken to the charge; thou ſtandeſt indicted of High Treaſon, by the name of</hi> John Lilburne <hi>late of</hi> London <hi>Gentleman, for that thou art a falſe Traytor, not having the fear of God before thy eyes, but being ſtirred up and moved by the inſtigation of the Devil,</hi> &amp;c.—After he had read it out, Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> ſaid, <hi>What ſaiſt thou</hi> John Lilburne, <hi>art thou guilty of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of which thou ſtandeſt indicted or not guilty. Lilburne</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That by the Laws of</hi> England <hi>he was not to anſwer queſtions againſt or concerning himſelf.</hi> Another Judge ſaid, <hi>Maſter</hi> Lilburne, <hi>by the Laws of the Land you are to plead to your charge, and it is no accuſing of your ſelf to ſay you are guilty or not guilty.</hi> Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> inſtanced the Petition of Right to the former purpoſe, he alſo excuſed, himſelf as he was ignorant of the formalities of the Law, having none of the Law Books in Engliſh; and therefore fore them to take away his life in a Language he underſtood not, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hard: therefore he humbly deſired to have Councel aſſigned him to conſult with. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> told him he could not grant him that favour, it was not conſiſtent with the Law. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſtill refuſed to plead without Councel, withal he ſaid, he was not guilty in any of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in manner or form as they were laid down in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, pointing to it, and withal ſaid <hi>Now I have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:116025:265"/>and crave the Liberties of</hi> England <hi>that you will aſſign me counſel.</hi> Maſter <hi>Boughton</hi> ſaid, <hi>By whom wilt thou be Tryed, Lilburne</hi> replyed, <hi>By the known Laws of</hi> England, <hi>and a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Jury of his equals, conſtituted by Law.</hi> One of the Clerks ſaid, <hi>you muſt ſay by God and your Countrey.</hi> Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſaid, he never read in the Laws of <hi>England</hi> that he was to plead in that manner. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> explained the word Countrey to him, ſaying, <hi>By it was meant a Jury of his equals.</hi> Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired as he had bin a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſeven moneths deprived of Books, that he might have a reaſonable time allowed him to prepare himſelf for his Plea and Defence, or elſe to knock him in the head in the place where he ſtood; for he muſt needs be deſtroyed, if they denyed him the means of his preſervation. After many of his evaſions, Judge <hi>Nichols</hi> told him that if he would not be lead by the proceedings of Law it would be worſe for him. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> inſtanced the freedom of his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Judges in effect told him that he was now at <hi>London</hi> on a different manner of fact. He anſwered, they might murther him if they would, obſerving Maſter <hi>Pride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi> the Atturney General, whiſpering Judge <hi>Thorpe</hi> in the ear, he ſaid on the Bench, <hi>It was not lawful for a Judge to be whiſpered.</hi> To which Judge <hi>Thorpe</hi> replyed, that as he was the proſecutor of the State againſt him, he might confer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with him. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> quoted to the contrary, <hi>Cooks Inſtitutes,</hi> the third part, <hi>Cap. Treaſon,</hi> upon which Judge <hi>Keble</hi> took him up ſhort, and ſaid, that if he would not come to ſomething, and behave himſelf according to the bounds of Reaſon and Law, he would cauſe his Jury to be returned. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> replyed that he deſired to have the priviledge of the Laws of God, which he ſaid, he himſelf muſt acknowledge to be the Law of <hi>England;</hi> and he was ſure that the Law of God was, that they ſhould do as they would be done by; now he ſaid, it could not be by the Laws of God for his adverſaries to have the helps of all
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:116025:265"/>manner of councels, by ſnares, quirks, tricks, and provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to take away his life, and for him to be denyed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to conſult with any to preſerve himſelf againſt ſuch potent malice. Judge <hi>Jermyn</hi> anſwered, the queſtion was not, whether the Law of God, and the Law of reaſon, and the Law of man may be conſonant to each other, and whether the Court or <hi>John Lilburne</hi> ſhall be Judges thereof, that was the queſtion, Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> crying for all equity to himſelf, but allowing the Court none. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> ſaid further, that when a man had done ſuch treaſonable things, that it was the Law of God that he ſhould anſwer directly and poſitively whether he were guilty or no; and if he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer not guilty, and they be not fully proved againſt him, there is no more to be ſaid, After ſome other trifling <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> compared the prerogative that he ſaid the Judges made uſe of, to <hi>Nebucadnezzar,</hi> that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to deſtroy <hi>Daniel</hi> by his prerogative, as he was to be thrown into the Lions Den; making this application, that if they would not allow him councel to conſult with, to make a Plea for his life, it was a vain thing for him to ſpend any more words. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> the afterwards Preſident of the High Court of Juſtice, replyed, Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is but the ſparks of that venemous heat that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and they may burſt out to prove you guilty before us, and in our preſence if ſo be that you are charged with, without any other proof or proceedings, for you may do it, I tell you that you may do it where you ſtand; therefore take heed what you ſay. Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> replyed, Sir, I have caſt up my account, and I know what it can coſt me; he bleſt God he had learnt to dye, having alwayes carryed his life in his hand, for about twelve years together. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, he ſhould not now lay it down, if he did not deſtroy or caſt away the Common-wealth; but if he went about to deſtroy the Common-wealth, the Common-wealth would deſtroy him. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> replyed, he deſired nothing
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:116025:266"/>but councel, and to produce his witneſſes. Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> the Atturney General anſwered, that if Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> had theſe concernments granted to him, it would be a preſident for all future times, by means of which there would be no ends of Tryals in criminal caſes; and that it was a wonderful ſtrange thing to him, that when the priſoner had pleaded the uſual way, that they did not immediately proceed to Tryal. He did deſire that Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> might be dealt with all legal, juſt, and fair preceedings of the Court; he did deſire accordingly the proceedings of the Common-wealth be ſo too, that Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> may be without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay according to the Law proceeded againſt for his noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Treaſons. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> immediately ſaid, well Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> the Court is very tender, not to take up any of your time, you have heard what was declared to you there, that Maſter Atturney hath made Proceſs againſt you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable to morrow at ſeven of the Clock, and therefore to ſpend more time would be your loſs and dammage: the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> are to take care to return the Jury to morrow morning, and therefore the Court doth adjourn till ſeven of the Clock to morrow in the morning, in the mean time they commit the priſoner at the Bar to the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> again a priſoner. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> ſaid, that he had more favour then any priſoner in <hi>England</hi> ever had; for by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> in matters of Treaſon, whereof Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> is indicted, he ought to have been Tryed preſently and immediately; and becauſe all the world ſhall know with what candor and juſtice the Court doth proceed againſt him, we deferred time till to morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the Courts extraordinary favour, and the doors are wide open, that all the world may know it. Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſaid, Sir I can ſhew you a hundred preſidents to the contrary to diſprove what you ſay. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> bids adjourn the Court. Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> humbly thanked the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for their extraordinary favour, and ſo the Curtains were
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:116025:266"/>drawn for that day, the Court having adjourned till the next morning, &amp; the Priſoner was remanded to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 26. of <hi>October</hi> the Friday following, he was brought to the Bar with his Brother Collonel <hi>Robert Lilburne,</hi> his Sollicitour Maſter <hi>Sprat,</hi> and ſome other of his friends, being hardly admitted; Judge <hi>Keble</hi> ſaying, your Brother ſhall not ſtand by you there, I will onely have one hold your Papers and Books, and the reſt not to trouble you, therefore let them come out of the Court. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> pleaded for his Councell, inſtancing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Rolfes</hi> Tryal at <hi>Oxford,</hi> about his intent to poiſon the King, where he had Councell allowed him: to which Judge <hi>Keble</hi> ſubtlely anſwered, Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> when you come to Tryal you ſhall ſee there will be no need of Councel: the Court will be inſtead of Councel to you; nay, the Court, if they ſee matter of Law for Councel, though you do not ask it, they will give it you, and therefore ſet your heart at reſt; for if there be any thing Rational in Law that we can ſpy out as well as your Councel, wee'l help you in it. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> anſwered, Sweet Sir, I pray but one word more, if you deny me what the Law affords me, and that which hath been granted to the Law by Cavalier Judges; yea, and by your fellow Judges, who are now in power at this day, the Lord deliver me from ſtanding in need of you to be my Councellours. Sayes <hi>Keble,</hi> we are upon our lives as well as you. Maſter <hi>Liburne</hi> replied, No by your Favor, not in ſo eminent a manner. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> replied, we are upon our lives and our ſouls to all eternity. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired to be heard one word; Judge <hi>Keble</hi> ſaid, he would hear no more. Upon which Maſter <hi>Prideaux</hi> deſired the Court would proceed, and not prolong time, being he had pleaded not guilty, and had confeſſed ſometing. <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> replied, No ſir, you do me wrong, and abuſe me, I never confeſſed any thing, neither did I plead not guilty; he ſaid, his Plea was conditional, grounded on their promiſes
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:116025:267"/>not to take any advantages of his ignorance in their Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> exaſperated at his obſtinacy, cried out, Go on, be ſilent: Maſter <hi>Lilburn</hi> deſired that at leaſt they would let him hear the grand Jury ſpeak; for he underſtood from ſome of themſelves, that they never found him guilty, but do conceive themſelves wronged by ſome words yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day that paſſed from ſome of the Judges, he deſired to hear them ſpeak. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> deſired him to be rational, a word he often uſed, and that he would be ſilent, and hear the Court; he told him he could loſe no more time to hear him; he bid the Crier call the Jury; the Crier called, and Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> earneſtly preſt to be heard, but could not, Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired to ſee their faces. Judge <hi>Keble</hi> warned Maſter <hi>Sprat, Johns</hi> Sollicitour, not to talk to the Priſoner, he ſaid he might ſtand and hold the Books, but he ſhould not come near the Priſoner to talk to him as he had done the day before. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſaid, that the Law allowed a ſtander by to ſpeak in the Priſoners behalf at the Bar, much more to whiſper to him, but more eſpecially if he were his Sollicitour.</p>
                     <p>The Crier called the names, <hi>Miles Petty, William Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, John Sherman, Thomas Dainty, Ralph Ely, Edward Keiſer, Edward Perkins, Ralph Packman, Francis Woodall, William Commins, Henry Hauſon, Roger Jenkenſon; Joſhua Hammond, Richard Allen, Richard Nevil, John Main, Henry Jooley, Arthur Due, Roger Sears, John Mayo, Henry Jooley, Arthur Due, Roger Sears.</hi> The Cryer, ſaid you good men of the City appear; <hi>Stephen Jues, John Sherman, Ralph Ely, Roger Jenkenſon, Roger Sears, John Mayo, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Murren.</hi> The Clerk of Court ſayes to the Jury, here is your Priſoner at the Bar preſented before the Court, here take your Jury of Life and Death; if therefore Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> you will challenge them, or any of them, you muſt challege them before that they go to be ſworn.</p>
                     <p>Cryer. Every man that can inform my Lords, the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:116025:267"/>and the Atturney General of the Commonwealth, againſt Maſter <hi>John Lilburn</hi> Priſoner at the Bar, of any Treaſon or Fellony committed by him, let them come forth, and they ſhall be heard; for the Priſoner ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his deliverance: and all others bound to give their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, are upon pain of forfeiture of their Recognizance to come in. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired to be heard a few words; the Judge told him he muſt talk in his legal time, and take legal exceptions, and then he ſhould be heard till midnight. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired to be heard, he ſaid, he did not know the faces of two men that were read to him, therefore he deſired that he might have time to conſider of them. Judge <hi>Keeble</hi> told him that he ought not to have it. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired the Judge that he would at leaſt vouchſafe him to have ſome friends by him that are Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> that knew them, to give him informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their quality and conditions, without which, he ſaid, they might as well hang him without a Tryal. Mr. <hi>Sprat</hi> or Maſter <hi>Robert Lilburn</hi> challenged one of the Jury, which the Judge excepted againſt, and commanded the Fellow in the white cap ſhould come out there, pull him out. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> replied, that they did not deal civilly according to their own Law; and now there was a full noiſe, the whole cry was, to pull down the Stag of the Petition of Right. The Jury being called, he excepted againſt ſeveral perſons of the Jury; ſix lived about <hi>Smithfield,</hi> one in <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Street,</hi> two in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> two in <hi>Broad-ſtreet,</hi> one in <hi>Friday-ſtreet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After his particular exception, Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> proceeds and reads his Indictment. Hold up thy hand <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> Thou ſtandeſt here indicted of High Treaſon by the name of <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> late of <hi>London</hi> Gentleman; for that thou as a falſe Traytour, not having the fear of God before thine eyes, but being ſtirred and moved up by the inſtigation of the Devil, didſt endeavour not onely to

                     <p>The Indictment being reading, and the noiſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Hall great, the priſoner ſaid he could not hear, and had ſome few lines before read over to him. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> therefore prayed the people to hold their peace; Gentlemen, I beſeech you, be quiet, (ſpeaking to the people)</p>
                     <p>Lord <hi>Keeble</hi> replyed, Quiet you your ſelf, we will quiet them for you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Cryer ſaid,</hi> If any man can give any Evidence to my Lords, the Juſtices of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> let him come in and he ſhall be heard.</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired to be heard to ſpeak two or three words.</p>
                     <p>Lord <hi>Keeble</hi> ſaid, It is not a fit time, you ſhall be heard in your due time, but hear what the witneſſes ſay firſt.</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> replyed, He conceived he was much wronged, in ſaying that he pleaded not guilty, for he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſuch plea, I appeal to the Court, and to all that heard me, whether I pleaded any ſuch plea; for before I plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Court became engaged to me, to take no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of my ignorance of the formalities of the Law, and promiſed to give me as much priviledge as my Lord Duke of <hi>Hambleton,</hi> and others enjoyed, before the Court of Juſtice. By your favours ſaid he, I pleaded conditionally, and now I make my abſolute Plea to the Indictment which was this; that he excepted againſt the matter, and form of it in matter, time and place, and humbly craved Counccel to aſſign, and plead to the errors thereof, He beſeecht them to hear him a few words. Sir, with favour, he humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:116025:270"/>liberty to ſpeak a few words; he ſaid, I ſhall keep me cloſe to that, which is my right and my duty, and that is to the matter of Law in my Indictment: There are many things put into the Indictment by the Teſtimonies of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes now ſworn, that are pretended to be acted in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries; whether that be according to Law or no, I do not know, whether you will judge it ſo or no, but ſure I am, if either thoſe expreſs Statutes, that I have already cited to the Jury, or the third part of <hi>Cooks Inſtitutes</hi> be Law, I ought not to be tryed for Treaſon, but by a Jury of the next Neighbour-hood, in the ſelf-ſame County, the fact is pretended to be committed in: and therefore it is very queſtionable to me, whether my Indictment be legal, for that it chargeth me with facts of treaſon, committed in three ſeveral Counties, and that being matter of Law, I deſire Counſel to argue that point in the firſt place: There are alſo a great many other exceptions I have to make againſt the Illegality of the Indictment, and having particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larized one, I humbly crave that which is my right by Law, that I may have Counſel aſſigned to me; you have ſaid, you will do what ſhall become ingenious and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, and juſt Judges in it, and therefore I crave leave according to my undoubted Right, to have Counſel aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to plead in matters of Law to the inſufficiency of the Indictment, and particularly to that point I have nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. There are alſo a great many things ariſe out of the matter of fact, that will be points of Law likewiſe, and ſome of them appear to be ſo, there were never two clear and poſitive witneſſes to one fact ſworn againſt me, but to moſt of the particular Treaſons there is but one a piece, and I cannot yield tha to be legal but queſtionable in the Law, which I deſire Counſel to diſpute: I know not any of all the Books fixed upon me, but the <hi>Out-cry,</hi> that hath two plain witneſſes to it, and yet it is not ſworn that I am the Author of it; the ſtate of the firſt is this, that I was at the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:116025:270"/>Printers before the Copy was taken away, and that I gave one of thoſe Books to a Souldier: to ſum up the Notes of the matter of fact, that thereon hath been endeavoured to be proved, is too hard a task to be done by me immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore I conceive it but juſt for you to aſſign me Counſel, to agree with the Counſel againſt me, what are the points of fact upon the proof, from which the points of Law are to be deducted; and whatever you, that call your ſelves my Judges, may think of this, yet I hope and verily believe, that theſe my honeſt fellow Citizens, that are the Gentlemen of my Jury, who have (thereby) as men, the iſſues of my life and death in their hands, and will think it but a juſt and rational motion and requeſt; and therefore before them again, I deſire to have Counſel aſſigned to plead in Law, to the errours of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo to the Law ariſing upon the fact; this with a larger priviledge, was granted by one of your own brother-Judges, to Major <hi>Rolfe</hi> laſt year, as his right by Law; and I do again appeal to Mr. Juſtice <hi>Nichols,</hi> then one of <hi>Rolfes</hi> Counſel; for the truth of this, I pray ſpeak Sir. is it not true? <hi>but the Judge ſitting, as if he had neither life nor ſoul,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lilburne further ſaid,</hi> I hope Sir, it doth not enter into your thoughts preſently to put me to an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted extemporary anſwer, to ſo large an Indictment as that is that hath been read againſt me; that it is poſſible for any mans brain, if it were as big as the biggeſt Magazine in <hi>London,</hi> to carry it in his head; and Sir, I hope you do not conceive that my memory is of a greater largeneſs then the greateſt Magazine in this City; you engaged unto me when I pleaded firſt to my Indictment, that you would not take exceptions nor advantage againſt me, for my ignorance in the formalities of the Law; I deſire you to make good your promiſe now unto me, and aſſign me Counſel to help my ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that ſo the Counſel againſt me and my Counſel may agree, as I have ſeen it done hereofore in the caſe of
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:116025:271"/>Duke <hi>Hambleton,</hi> upon the points of fact, from which Law is to be deducted; and if you pleaſe to grant me this legal and equitable favour, I ſhall think my ſelf very much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto you; without which juſtice, I cannot conceive upon what ground it can be apprehended I can go on: for my time and ſtrength now it is ſo far ſpent, that I conceive you cannot think my body is made of ſteel, to ſtand here four or five hours together, ſpending my ſpirits to anſwer ſo many as I have to deal with, and be able after all this, to ſtand to return an anſwer to above five hours charge, and that upon life, when it ſeems you will ſuffer me to mend no blots; I hope you do not lie upon the catch to weary and tire me out, by putting more upon me then a horſe is able to endure; and then go about to hang me, becauſe I through tiredneſs, want bodily ſtrength and abilities to make and pronounce my defence.</p>
                     <p>Sir, to my apprehenſion, there does ariſe upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact divers diſputes in Law; I beſeech you therefore allow me my right in Law, by aſſigning me Counſel to help me where I am ignorant, and you ſhall ſee, I ſhall do that which ſhall become an ingenuous and rational man, and I will put my ſelf clearly upon the Trial of the Countrey or my Jury according to the Law.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Keble</hi> replyed, <hi>Mr.</hi> Lilburne, <hi>This that you have heard, and that we have patiently ſat to hear, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a ſtool for you to have ſat upon, to have given you that liberty that no body ſhould interrupt you more then us, you have heard the fair courſe that hath been taken in it; The Books, the charges upon the matter, they are but three, they are not hard for your memory; The particulars of thoſe we do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Jury ſhould remember them; the Books are here, they have of them; but amongſt them there are many more, but free your ſelf from the matter of fact, if you can, and theſe Books; and when you have freed your ſelf from the matter of fact charged upon you, and then make it appear that from the
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:116025:271"/>matter of Fact Law ariſes, and then if you can, when the matter of Fact is clear, and Law doth ariſe, you ſhall have Counſel; and you ſhall have no defect in us to interrupt you, but to help you in what we may properly know as our right to do; but if you do not firſt clear and make out this which is the iſſue upon the point, to anſwer the matter ouf Fact, we cannot allow you any Counſel: the thing that is to be diſputed cannot poſſible be much on your ſide, it will be but very ſhort; for it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I ſay, to be much in time, or confuſion of your memory, to give an anſwer to this particular matter of Fact: the firſt is the publiſhing of thoſe Books, and the owning of them; and the next is the Books themſelves; But this muſt be firſt cleared, before you can have any Counſel aſſigned you at all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it was high time for Collonel <hi>John</hi> to pretend that he was tired out, he requeſted the Court for a Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, which was granetd him; afterwards he fell to it back and ſides.</p>
                     <p>Sayes he, Well, ſeeing I muſt to it, the will of God be done; but his brother being next to him, was heard to preſs him to pauſe a little more; No brother, ſaith he, my work is done, I will warrant you by the ſtrength of God, I will knock the nail upon the head; and ſo he went into the Bar, and ſet the Chair before him, and laid his Law Books open upon it, in order as he intended to uſe them, and being ready, ſaid, Sir I humbly crave the favour, ſince it is my hard lot and fortune, at leaſt in my own apprehenſion, to have ſo much hard meaſure and injuſtice as I have, to know whether or no you will permit me, after that I have pleaded to a matter of Fact, according to the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that has been allowed to the higheſt Traytors in all the Books that I have read of, that I may ſpeak in my own behalf unto the Jury, my Countrey-men, upon whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, integrity, and honeſty, my life, and the Lives and Liberties of the honeſt men of this Nation now lyes, who are in Law Judges of Law as well as Fact, and you onely the
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:116025:272"/>pronouncers of their Sentence, Will, and Minde; I ſay, I deſire to know when I have pleaded to matter of Fact, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will be pleaſed to give me leave to ſpeak to them a few words beſides.</p>
                     <p>Lord Keble. <hi>Maſter</hi> Lilburne, <hi>quietly expreſs your ſelf, and you do well, the Jury are Judges of matter of Fact altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Judge</hi> Cook <hi>ſayes ſo; but I tell you, the opinion of the Court, they are Judges of matter of Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Lilburne.</hi> The Jury by Law are not onely Judges of Fact, but of Law alſo; and you that call your ſelves Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Law are no more but Norman Intruders, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in truth, if the Jury pleaſe, are no more but Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to pronounce their Verdict.</p>
                     <p>Judge <hi>Jermyn</hi> replyed, <hi>Was there ever ſuch a damnable blaſphemous hereſie as this is, to call the Judges of the Law Ciphers? Sir, I entreat you give me leave to read the words of the Law then, for to the Jury I apply, as my Judges both in the Law and Fact.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sayes the Lord <hi>Keble, We will not deny you a tittle of the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sayes Judge <hi>Jermyn, Let all the hearers know, the Jury ought to take notice of it, that the Iudges that are ſworn, that are twelve in number, they have ever been the Iudges of the Law, from the firſt time that ever we can read or hear that Law was truly expreſt in</hi> England, <hi>and the Iury are onely Iudges, whether ſuch a thing were done or no, they are onely Iudges of matter of Fact.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſayes, I deny it, here's your own Law to diſprove you, and therefore let not me but read it; it is a hard caſe when a man is upon the Tryal of his life, that you will not ſuffer him to read the Law to the Jury, for his own defence; he was ſure they have cauſed to be read at large thoſe Laws that made againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Lord <hi>Keble</hi> ſaid, <hi>But I ſhall pronounce to clear the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of that Law, whatſoever others will pretend againſt it that know it not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="507" facs="tcp:116025:272"/>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> replyed, Sir, under favour I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with any thing, but what is pertinent to my preſent purpoſe; here is the firſt part of <hi>Cooks Inſtitutes,</hi> it is owned by all the Lawyers that I know, or ever heard of in <hi>England</hi> for good Law.</p>
                     <p>Judge <hi>Keble</hi> anſwered, <hi>If you can convince us, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Law does concern you the Iury, you ſay ſomething.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> anſwered, Sir, I have been ſhuffled too much out of my Liberties already, give me leave to read but the Law to the Jury, I will make uſe of nothing now to them, but your own words; and when I have done, I will leave my ſelf to them, and the guidance of God upon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and having the Book open in his hand, he ſaid in the firſt part of <hi>Cooks Inſtitutes, ſex.</hi> 366. <hi>fol.</hi> 226, 227, 228. in his Expoſition of <hi>Ployden</hi> hath theſe words.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Keble</hi> anſwered, <hi>Have we dealt ſo fairly with you all this while, pray be confident, thoſe that are quotations there, are not for your purpoſe; but I thought how good a Lawyer you were, for to ſet</hi> Cooks <hi>Commentaries upon</hi> Ployden; <hi>when there is no ſuch Book or Commentary: go to your mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, which is clear, but for this let it fall down, and ſpare your ſelf, and trouble your ſelf no more with</hi> Cook; <hi>he has no Commentary upon</hi> Ployden. <hi>But Maſter</hi> Lilburne <hi>preſt to ſpeak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Judge <hi>Iermyn</hi> cryes out, <hi>Hold Sir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> replyes, What will not you allow me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to read your Law? O unrighteous and bloody Judges!</p>
                     <p>Judge <hi>Iermyn</hi> anſwers, <hi>By the fancy of your own minde, you would puzzle the Iury, we know the Book a little better then you do, there is no ſuch Book as</hi> Cooks <hi>Commentary upon</hi> Ployden.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Keble</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sir, you ſhall not read it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Judge <hi>Iermyn ſayes he cannot be ſuffered to read the Law, he had broached an erroneous opinion, that the Iury are Iudges of the Law, which is enough to deſtroy all the Law in the Land; there was never ſuch a damnable hereſie broached in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="508" facs="tcp:116025:273"/>
                     <p>The Cryer cryes out, <hi>Hear the Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> anſwers, Do your pleaſure, then here Ile dye: Jury, take notice of their injuſtice; but ſeeing they will not hear me, I appeal to you, and ſay, It is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter for an abler man then I am, in ſo many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions as I meet with, to miſtake <hi>Ployden</hi> for <hi>Littleton;</hi> I am ſurehere is <hi>Cooks</hi> Commentaries upon <hi>Littleton,</hi> and theſe be his words, <hi>In this caſe the Recognitors of the Aſſize may ſay and render to the Juſtices their Verdict at large upon the whole matter,</hi> which I am ſure is good Law, foraſmuch as we ſee it continually done in all actions of Treſpaſs or Aſſault, where the Jury doth not onely judge of the validity of the proof of the Fact, but alſo of the Law, by aſſigning what damages they think is juſt.</p>
                     <p>Lord <hi>Keble</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am ſure you are in an errour, in a groſs one, as poſſible a man can be in; this is ſo groſs, that I thought it could not have come from Maſter</hi> Lilburne, <hi>that profeſſeth himſelf to be a rational and knowing man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Lilburn</hi> goes on. And in another place he ſaith, <hi>For as well as the Jurors may have Cognizance of the Leaſe, they alſo as well may have Cognizance of the condition.</hi> And further there <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, <hi>Here it is to be obſerved, that a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Verdict, or at large, may be given in any Action, and upon any Iſſue, be the Iſſue General or Special.</hi> And in Section 368. <hi>Littleton</hi> hath theſe words; <hi>Alſo in ſuch Caſe, where the Inqueſt may give their Verdict at large, if they will take upon them the knowledge of the Law, upon the matter they may give their verdict generally. Cooks</hi> words upon it are fully to the ſame purpoſe, who ſaith, <hi>Although the Jury, if they will take upon them</hi> (as <hi>Littleton</hi> here ſaith) <hi>the knowledge of the Law, may give a general Verdict.</hi> I am ſure this is pertinent to my purpoſe, and now I have done Sir.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Keble</hi> replyes, <hi>You have ſpent a little time, but you have done your ſelf no good; I thought you had
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:116025:273"/>underſtood the Law better then I ſee you do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Lilburne,</hi> Now Sir, as to matter of Fact, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your own deſire, ſeeing you have broke your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and will allow me no Councel, but lye at catch with me, ſayes he, I ſhall come to it without any Preamble. The Statute of the 1 <hi>Edward</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. (I deſire the Jury may take notice of the Statutes) and the 5. and 6. of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. here's the Statute Book, which doth expreſly declare, That no man ſhall be condemned for Treaſon, petty Treaſon, nor any ſuch like Crimes, but by the Evidence and clear proof of two legal and ſufficient Witneſſes. Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his third part <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> Chapter of High Treaſon, is abſolutely of the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>folio</hi> 12, In this branch, ſayes he, four things are to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, this word (proveablement) proveably, that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on direct and manifeſt proof, not upon conjectural preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions or inferences, or ſtrains of wit, but upon good and ſufficient proof of two Witneſſes, and this is <hi>folio</hi> 12. And here in the Adverb, (proveablement) proveably hath a great force, and ſignifieth a direct and plain proof.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, This word (attaint) neceſſarily implyeth that he be poceeded with, and attainted, according to the due courſe and proceedings of Law, and not by abſolute power, or by other means, as in former times it hath been uſed.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>folio</hi> 24. <hi>Chap. Petty Treaſon,</hi> he ſaith, It hath been holden, that upon the Tryal of miſpriſion of Treaſon, there muſt be two lawful Witneſſes as well upon the Tryal as the Indictment, as it was reſolved by the Juſtices in the Lord <hi>Lumleys</hi> caſe. <hi>Hill.</hi> 14. <hi>Eliz.</hi> reported by the Lord <hi>Dier</hi> under his own hand, and in the margent he hath this note upon it, That this is the laſt reſolution of the Judges upon it: And a litttle below in the ſame <hi>folio,</hi> and <hi>folio</hi> 25 he ſaith, Therefore upon the Indictment, which is in manner of an
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:116025:274"/>accuſation, by the Statutes of 1. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. Two lawful Witneſſes are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. And in <hi>folio</hi> 240. he hath the ſame; his words are theſe: Attainders of Treaſon, &amp;c. ought to be upon plain and direct evidence, (as before is ſaid;) for if the party be executed, reſtitution may be had of his Lands, but never can be had of his life. Now I have done Sir.</p>
                     <p>Lord <hi>Keble. I hope the Jury hath ſeen the Evidence ſo plain, and ſo fully, that it doth confirm them to do their duty, and to finde the Priſoner guilty of what is charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>J. <hi>Iermyn, This that you have ſaid, makes much for the Iury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards there were ſeveral witneſſes examined, Mr. <hi>Thomas Newcomb</hi> as to a Book he printed, the laſt ſheet of it, entituled, <hi>The Apprentices Out-cry,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Newcomb</hi> by circumſtances acknowledged, was taken before it was perfected. Afterwards <hi>John Took, John Skinner, Thomas Lewis, John Hawkins, John Merriman,</hi> the Witneſſes were ſworn; all which Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> did ſo order with his Queries and confident Queſtions, that they were at their wits ends; Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> all this while having the ſubtlety not to acknowledge his own hand, which occaſioned Maſter Atturney <hi>Prideaux</hi> to ſay, you may ſee the valiantneſs of the Champion for the peoples Liberties, he will not own his own hand. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſaid, <hi>he denied nothing, but would have them to prove it.</hi> For his other Book, <hi>an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of High Treaſon againſt</hi> Oliver <hi>and his Son-in-law</hi> Henry Ireton, <hi>late Members of the late forcibly diſſolved Houſe of Commons, preſented to the publick view by Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Collonel</hi> John Lilburne, <hi>cloſe Priſoner in the</hi> Tower <hi>of</hi> London. Mr. Atturney ſaid, My Lord, I doubt he will not own it. Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſaid again, he ſhould deny nothing he had done; but he had read the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> which taught him to anſwer no queſtions againſt himſelf; he ſaid, that he had read that it was practiſed by our Saviour Chriſt and his
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:116025:274"/>Apoſtles, our Saviour anſwering <hi>Pilate</hi> with onely, <hi>Thou ſayeſt it.</hi> For as to his Preparative to the hue and cry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sir <hi>Arthur Haſelrig,</hi> the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> ſaid, it was true that Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Lilburne</hi> gave him ſuch a Book in the Tower, but he could not ſay whether that was the ſame Book he delivered him. Mr. <hi>Nutleigh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Radny,</hi> two Witneſſes, put Mr. <hi>John</hi> ſhroudly to his ſhifts. He was come to St. <hi>Francis</hi> his equivocation, when one askt him that was newly robbed, which way the thief went, he ſtretching out his arm, ſaid, not this way, meaning through his ſleeve.</p>
                     <p>For his Book called, <hi>The Legal Fundamental Liberties of</hi> England, the Atturney General did not put much weight upon that, as alſo of his Book <hi>De ſalva libertate;</hi> but he proceeded to produce an Act of Parliament of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>May</hi> 1649. declaring what offences ſhould be adjudged High Treaſon, which were read over. The chief clauſes that Maſter Atturney inſiſted upon againſt Mr. <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> were theſe; That if any perſon ſhall maliciouſly or adviſedly publiſh by writing, printing, or openly declaring that the ſaid Government is uſurped, tyrannical, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or that the Commons aſſembled in Parliament are not the Supream Authority of this Nation: Theſe, ſayes Mr. Atturney, we ſhall joyn together with Mr. <hi>Lilburnes</hi> books; to which making particular application, he inferred, that Mr. <hi>Lilburns</hi> Books were accordingly trayterous; to which purpoſe he cauſed the Clerk to make particular references to ſeveral pages of his Books. Maſter <hi>Prideaux</hi> cauſing theſe words to be read out of one of Maſter <hi>Lilburns</hi> Books, <hi>That the Parliament are uſurping Tyrants, and their new thing, called their Councel of State, undoubtedly the moſt, if not all of them, muſt go to</hi> Tyburn <hi>or</hi> Tower-hill, <hi>there by the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Ax to receive their juſt deſerts, to which he affixed, Amen.</hi> There is an <hi>Amen</hi> pronounced to us, ſayes Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney, let him have it that deſerves it, and according to
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:116025:275"/>the Atturneyes direction, ſeveral pages of his Books were ſtill quoted and read on; then Mr. Atturney expreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Court, to this purpoſe, ſayes he, <hi>My Lords, if I ſhould ſay nothing more to the Iury but what hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced and ſaid, there is pregnant proof already; but yet my Lord, further to prove the malice of Mr.</hi> Lilburnes <hi>heart, and that he did intend to ſubvert and deſtroy the Parliament,</hi> he cauſed the Clerk to read ſome other paſſages of his Books, out of which he proved that he had blown a Trumpet for all his friends to take up Arms againſt the Parliament; to which purpoſe he went about to ſeduce the Army, which he calls his fellow Countrey-men. Thus I have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt the particular advantages that might be for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneys Plea to Maſter <hi>Lilburns</hi> detriment, to the proving of no leſs then High Treaſon through ſeveral pages, being quoted ſucceſſively throughout every Book, to that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined purpoſe. Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> after he had compared the Judges to the Scribes and Phariſees, and their uſage of himſelf to Chriſt, cloſing to his former expreſſion, Thou ſayeſt Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> they are my Books, he bid him prove it. Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> ſpeaking to the Jury, ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen there are proofs enough and too many; that he had no more to ſay to them, but that if they reſpected the government of the Parliament, the honour of the Councel of State, the honour of the Nation, or of the Army, or the preſervation of the Law, they could not but ſay that the priſoner was guilty of ſuch crimes and treaſons as he was lawfully accuſed of, and accordingly they could not but finde him ſo.</hi> He ended, that he deſired the Act of Treaſon might be made uſe of. Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> again pretended himſelf to be tired and oppreſſed, but at the preſent not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtood, he deſired that he might refreſh his body with the air, which could not be obtained. All this while he ſtruggled out a little reſpite, at laſt after theſe lingerings, the Judge reſolvingto be no longer delayed, commanded the Chair to be taken away, for it grew late. Now it was
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:116025:275"/>time for Maſter <hi>Lilburne</hi> to ſhow himſelf a right Collonel <hi>Iohn,</hi> after his ſo long baffling and fooling of the Judges, he was Counſel to himſelf; he pleaded his own Cauſe with ſuch ſubtilty, with ſuch a perfect recollection of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tranſactions of his Tryal, and withal indiſputably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of his Jury, he knew he could not tread awry; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left invulnerable, except in the heel, which was onely in his own moſt neceſſary inſcrutable reſervations; he cloſed his long ſpeech of clearing himſelf with ſome neceſſary inſinuations to the Jury, where the ſtrength of this Sampſon did chiefly lie. To them he declared the integrity of his life, his merits, and the hard uſage he had received from the preſent Government; being interrupted, he earneſtly deſired the Jury to take notice of the blood-thirſty cruelty and malice of his enemies, all the while, ſoundly clawing of his Jury with ſuch words, that he was happy in the care and conſcience of his honeſt Jury, fellow Citizens, and Freemen of <hi>England,</hi> who were to be the Conſervators and Judges of his life, having in themſelves the Judicial power of the Land, the Judges that ſit there, being no more if they pleaſed, but as Ciphers to pronounce the ſentence of their Clerks, to ſay Amen. They being at the beſt in their originals, but the Norman Conquerers Obtruders. He called his Jury the keepers of his life, at whoſe hands if they did not do him juſtice, the Lord would require his blood; he deſired the Lord God omnipotent to direct then, the Governour of heaven and earth, and all things therein contained, to go along with them, and give them counſel to do that which is juſt for his glory: the people with one voice crying, Amen, Amen. Which made the Judges look untowardly about them, and cauſed Major Gen. <hi>Skippon</hi> to ſend for three freſh Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies more of Foot Souldiers. After which, Mr. Atturney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral told the Jury, that they had heard the evidence, in the behalf of State, laying the buſineſs to their conſcience, that they ſhould be careful to do juſtice. Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> enforced
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:116025:276"/>this as his main argument to the Jury, that there were none that ſwore as to his hand, that there was no Book proved his; and if that of the agreement of the people were his, it was before the Acts had a being or were in print. Maſter Atturney replyed, <hi>Mr.</hi> Lilburne, <hi>theſe are but your own gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Iury anſwers to the matter of Fact, they are upon their Oaths ſworn to do things that are juſt and right.</hi> My Lords, ſaid he, I leave the evidence to them; all that he had more to ſay, was, that Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> ſince he came before the Lords, had not ſo much as owned the Power of the Court, but often called them Cyphers and the like. Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> deſired that the Jury might read the firſt Chapter of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> in the Statute Book, and the laſt Clauſe of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the 13. of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but Judge <hi>Keble</hi> when according to the cuſtom he was to ſpeak to the Jury, ſaid, That Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> had cited two Statutes to prove that there muſt be two Witneſſes, whereas if there were but one Witneſs to each Fact, it were enough in Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, Gentlemen of the Jury, what you have heard muſt not ſtick with you, you are not bound affirmatively to have two Witneſſes, but that one Witneſs where the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances concur, that is ſufficient; that which ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you, was, to conſider the ſtrength of the accuſation which reſted in the Books, and did conſiſt of three heads, which were laid down in the Books themſelves. Firſt, the ſo far vilifying the Parliament and State, as it was now eſtabliſht in <hi>England.</hi> The ſecond lookt on the counſels and incitations of Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> for the ſtirring up of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Motions, and Wars in the Nation. The third are the things cited in the Books to that end and purpoſe to divide the Army. Theſe he ſaid were the three main charges, and theſe the Books that came from him did ſo plainly teſtifie: that the Books were proved to be his, they were fit Judges of, and it clearly appeared by thoſe his Books that theſe things were his invention. He coucluded,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:116025:276"/>that theſe Books being admitted, he ſaid, that never man that acted the higheſt of Treaſons as he had done, had ſo much liberty as he; nor any man of his condition, or any condition in <hi>England,</hi> that was indicted in ſuch caſe, ever had a Tryal in ſuch a Court, ſuch an Auditory, ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as he had. Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> replyed, the more was his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he had rather it had been any where elſe. The Judge enlarged himſelf, that his plot was of ſuch a nature, that it ſtruck at no lefs then the ſubverſion of the Common-wealth, that there was never ſuch another did proceed from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man as he was; and therefore he deſired the Maſters of the Jury to look into their conſciences, as he ſaid to them; they having plainly before their eyes that there was not in one particular a ſingle teſtimony but was aggravated with ſeveral circumſtances. Therefore as he ſaid, they being proper Judges of matter of Fact, being of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, if they fully apprehended the dangerous things plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Mr. <hi>Lilburnes</hi> Books, they would elearly finde that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the like Treaſon hatcht in <hi>England;</hi> ſo in Gods name, as the priſoner did lead to their conſciences, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to go and do. Other petty tranſactions and croſs anſwers paſſed betwixt Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> and his Judges, not worth the taking notice of; the Jury went forth at four of the Clock, the Court adjourned till ſix, the Court com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> and the Sheriffs to carry the priſoner to the <hi>Iriſh Chamber,</hi> which they did; the priſoner ſtaid about three quarters of an hour, and the Jury being come to the Court again. the priſoner was ſent for; and after the Cryer had cauſed ſilence, the Jurors names were called over again, the Clerk askt them if they were agreed, the Jury anſwered, yes; the Clerk askt who ſhould ſpeak for them; the Jury ſaid, the fore-man. The Cryer ſaid, <hi>John Lilburne</hi> hold up thy hand, what ſay you, look upon the priſoner? is he guilty of the Treaſons charged upon him or not guilty? the fore-man anſwered, not guilty of all of
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:116025:277"/>them. The Clerk replyed, not of all the treaſons, or of any of them that are laid to his charge. The fore-man anſwered, No, not of all, nor of any one of them. The Clerk ſaid again, did he fly for the ſame, the fore-man replyed, No. Which no, he pronounced with a loud voice; immediately the whole multitude of people in the Hall for joy of the priſoners ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal gave ſuch a loud and unanimous ſhout, as is believed was never heard in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> which laſted for about half an hour without intermiſſion; the Bells being rung, and Bonefires made in moſt Streets in <hi>London.</hi> That night, divers of Maſter <hi>Lilburnes</hi> friends went to the Judges, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Councel of State, by whoſe importunities and by the help of the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Groby,</hi> Collonel <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Martin,</hi> his diſcharge was procured. I ſhall cloſe up the large particulars of this ſo eminent a Tryal, with what I heard reported, one merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, That the Jury-men very well deſerved the Medalls that Collonel <hi>John</hi> preſented them with, and that their own Pictures needed not to be cut, for they had engraven them themſelves, and had queſtionleſs made admirable draughts for future Juries, to coppy out the Liberties of the Subject.</p>

               <p>About the ſame time were dangerous inſurrections, and horrible riots committed in the North, the occaſion thus:
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:116025:277"/>at the expence of 175046. pounds, or thereabouts; there was drained or laid dry, 160000 Acres of land, lying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous within the Counties of <hi>York, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> not worth before three ſhillings and four pence an Acre one with another; the which was made worth ſome ten, other twelve, yea ſome twenty ſhillings an Acre; in the Mannor of <hi>Epworth</hi> was 7400. Acres, which had been peaceably poſſeſſed by the Drainers, and their aſſigns, the ſpace of ten years; but ſeveral perſons envying them the benefit accrewing thereby, in a tumultuous manner came into the level, and breaking down the fences, deſtroyed and laid waſte above 4000. Acres of drained Land, and pulled down ſeveral houſes ſtanding thereon.</p>
               <p>Others afterward, ſeveral dayes (during the flowing of the ſpring tide) violently forced open a Sewer called <hi>Snow-Sewer,</hi> planted upon the River of <hi>Trent,</hi> purpoſely to let in the Waters; the which courſe they continued, till they had drowned 8000. Acres of Corn and Rape then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Corn ſtacks generally half way, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of mens houſes and habitations, by the ſpace of ten weeks. Now fearing they ſhould be puniſhed for theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies, and deſirous to keep what they had thus gotten, they drew to their aſſiſtance Mr. <hi>Lilburne, J. W.</hi> and one <hi>Noddel</hi> a Solicitour; who notwithſtanding the Court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, made a decree for eſtabliſhing the poſſeſſion again with thoſe from whom they had wreſted it, and that this decree was publiſhed upon the place in preſence of divers of the inhabitants; they openly declared, <hi>That they would not give any obedience thereunto, nor to any order of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, or Parliament;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>they could make as good a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament themſelves;</hi> ſome ſaid, <hi>It was a Parliament of Clouts, and that if they ſent Forces; they would raiſe Forces to reſiſt them:</hi> moreover from words they proceeded to action, ſo that within ten dayes time, they totally demoliſhed the whole Town of <hi>Stantoft,</hi> and other houſes thereabouts, to
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:116025:278"/>the number of eighty two habitations, defaced the Church, burnt Stables and Out-houſes broke in pieces a Wind-mill, deſtroyed all the Corn and Rape on the ground, no leſs then 3400. Acres, ſo as the dammage at that time was eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to be 80000. pounds or more.</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Lilburne</hi> with his aſſociates, agrees with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men of <hi>Epworth,</hi> that in conſideration of 2000 Acres of Land for him and <hi>J. W.</hi> and 200. Acres to <hi>Noddel,</hi> they would defend them in all thoſe riots, and inſurrections, and maintain them in poſſeſſion of the reſt of the Land; this bargain being made, <hi>Lilburne</hi> with <hi>Noddel</hi> and others, came to <hi>Stantoft</hi> Church on the Lords day, and forced the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation from thence, employing the ſame to the uſe of a Stable, Cow-houſe, Slaughter-houſe, and to lay his Hay and Straw therein.</p>
               <p>For theſe tumultuous practices (as alſo for joyning with one Mr. <hi>Primate,</hi> in ſeeking to defraud the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the Collory of <hi>Harraton</hi> in the County of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the ſequeſtered eſtate of <hi>Thomas Wray</hi> Eſquire, which Mr. <hi>Primate</hi> pretended a right unto, though upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it proved otherwiſe) this following Act for his Fine and Baniſhment, was publiſht againſt him.</p>
               <p>Whereas upon the fifteenth day of <hi>January,</hi> in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſix hundred fifty one, A Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given in Parliament againſt the ſaid Lieutenant Collonel <hi>John Lilburne</hi> for high Crimes and Miſdemeanours by him committed, relating to a falſe, malicious, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Petition heretofore preſented to the Parliament by one <hi>Joſiah Primate</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Leather-ſeller, as by the due proceedings had upon the ſaid Petition, and the Judgement thereupon given at large appeareth: Be it therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted by this preſent Parliament; and by the Authority of the ſame, that the fine of three thouſand pounds impoſed upon the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne</hi> to the uſe of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by the Judgement aforeſaid, ſhall be forthwith le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:116025:278"/>by due proceſs of Law, to the uſe of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth accordingly. And be it further enacted, that the ſum of two thouſand pounds impoſed by the ſaid Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> to be paid to Sir <hi>Arthur Heſilrige</hi> for damages, and the ſum of two thouſand pounds likewiſe impoſed by the ſaid Judgement upon the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> to be paid to <hi>James Ruſſel, Edward Winſlow, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Molins</hi> and <hi>Arthus Squib,</hi> in the ſaid Judgement na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; that is to ſay, to each of them five hundred pounds for their damages, ſhall be forthwith paid accordingly: And that the ſaid Sir <hi>Arthur Heſilrige, James Ruſſel, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Winſlow, William Molins</hi> and <hi>Arthur Squib,</hi> their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and Adminiſtrators, ſhall have the like remedy and proceedings at Law reſpectively, againſt the ſaid <hi>John Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> his Heirs, Executors, Adminiſtrators and Aſſigns, for the recovery of the reſpective ſums ſo given to them by the ſaid Judgement, as if the ſaid reſpective ſums had been due by ſeveral Recognizances in the nature of a Statute Staple, acknowledged unto them ſeverally by the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> upon the ſaid fifteenth day of <hi>January,</hi> in the year of our Lord, one thouſand ſix hundred fifty one. And be it likewiſe enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, that the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne</hi> ſhall (within twenty dayes to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from the ſaid fifteenth day of <hi>January,</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred fifty one) depart out of <hi>England, Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Iſlands, Territories and Dominions thereof: And in caſe the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne</hi> at any time after the expiration of the ſaid twenty dayes to be accompted as aforeſaid, ſhall be found, or ſhall be remaining within <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> or within any of the Iſlands, Territories or Dominions thereof; the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne</hi> ſhall be, and is hereby adjudged a Fellon, and ſhall be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as a Fellon, without benefit of Cleargy. And it is laſtly enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, that all and every perſon and perſons, who ſhall after the expiration of the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:116025:279"/>ſaid twenty dayes, wittingly relieve, harbor, or conceal the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> he being in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or any the Territories, Iſlands, or Dominions thereof, ſhall be hereby adjudged acceſſary of Fellony after the Fact: And all Judges, Juſtices, Majors, Bayliffs, Sheriffs, and all other Officers, as well Military as Civil in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective places, are hereby required to be aiding and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in apprehending the ſaid <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> and in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Act in due execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lilburne</hi> hereupon ſets Sail for <hi>Holland,</hi> with a reſolution as he ſet forth in print, <hi>Never to ſee</hi> England <hi>ſo long as</hi> Cromwels <hi>hateful and beaſtly tyranny laſted, unleſs it were in a way to purſue him as the grandeſt Tyrant and Traytor that ever</hi> England <hi>bred;</hi> ſome report that during his abode there, he negotiated with the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> Collonel <hi>Charles Lloyd,</hi> and others of the Royal Party, that for the ſum of ten thouſand pounds he would deſtroy the Lord General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the Parliament and Councel of State, that then ſat at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſettle <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> in his Throne in <hi>England,</hi> or elſe he would have a piece of him nailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every poſt in <hi>Bruges.</hi> But for the truth of this (beſides his own denyal) I cannot conceive he ſhould have any thought that Party would truſt him (eſpecially with ſuch a ſum of money) having before declared himſelf ſo great an enemy to the late King.

               <p>His Wife alſo ſollicites the General for a paſs, which though not granted, yet over he comes; ſo confident he was, that at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in his way to <hi>London,</hi> he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begins to boaſt of his own intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He had no need of a paſs, being as good a man as</hi> Cromwel, <hi>and that he did not fear what he could do unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding his monſtrous confidence, he was committed to priſon, and by order of Parliament, tryed for his life, at the Seſſions Houſe in the <hi>Old-Bailey, Auguſt</hi> the 20. 1653. where he pleaded that the Act whereupon he was Indicted, was a lie, a falſhood; that it had no Law nor Reaſon in it. That the Parliament could not make any Act of Parliament ſince the Kings head was cut off; that by the ſame Law they voted him to death, they might vote his honeſt twelve Jury men; calling Jehovah to witneſs, and proteſting before God, Angels, and Men, that he was not the <hi>John Lilburne</hi> intended in the Act; whereupon this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:116025:280"/>following the example of the former, ſatisfied with his anſwers, and not queſtioning the validity of the Act, found him not guilty.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what endeavours were uſed to rid the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, by tryals, baniſhment, and what not, though in vain, when as many a more heroick ſpirit and gallant heart far tranſcending him in birth and parts, have fallen by the Sword of Juſtice, in the twinkling of an eye: truth it is, he was a man of a reſtleſs and invincible ſpirit, that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be deterred with threats, nor won with favours though (as it is reported) 3000. pounds was given out of the ſale of <hi>Theobalds</hi> as a ſop to ſtop his mouth; he was queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of a moſt implacable ſpirit, working and reſtleſs as the Sea, not to be appeaſed but with the blood of his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; nor can I deny but ſome of thoſe things he aimed at were honeſt and uſeful for the people, but he ſteered not the right courſe to attain thoſe ends.</p>
               <p>It may be admired at by ſome how ſuch an illiterate perſon as <hi>Lilburne,</hi> one whoſe breeding promiſed him more skill in his laſt trade of Sope, then in <hi>Cook,</hi> or to have had better judgement in ruſticity in a Plow, then in <hi>Plowden;</hi> who from this low riſe mounted no higher then to inferiour employments, until in the late Wars he ſomewhat advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged and preferred himſelf by his Sword; I ſay it may ſeem ſtrange to ſome how this perſon thus qualified, ſhould come to have ſo much knowledge and underſtanding in the Law? for anſwer to which, it is to be underſtood that Mr. <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> had formerly turned over ſome Statute Books, in which he had made a ſmall progreſs, and that afterwards, at ſuch time as he was committed in the <hi>Tower,</hi> there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a priſoner there (though for a different Cauſe) that heart of Oak, and a pillar of the Law, Judge <hi>Jenkins;</hi> who finding <hi>Lilburne</hi> of an accute Wit, and one who dared to ſpeak what ſome puſilanimous ſpirits were afraid to entruſt their thoughts with, he ſelected him as fit perſon to bandy againſt
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:116025:280"/>the preſent Government, and by weakening their power, to advance his Maſters intereſt; hereupon he helps him with tools wherewith to let up his trade, ſo that in ſhort ſpace <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>Cooks Inſtitutions</hi> were made his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; by which means he quickly grew ſo cunning a gameſter, that like unto a cat, throw him never ſo high, he would be ſure to pitch upon his feet. Thus the old Judge and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reverend Divine in his learned volume of prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, publiſht, to hook in the Independant party, ſo ſtrangely miſtook themſelves, as that they could not have done their own cauſe a greater miſchief.</p>
               <p>But the Squib is now almoſt run to the end of the Rope, we ſhall in the laſt place preſent our <hi>Proteus</hi> in the ſhape of a Quaker; the perſon that converted him was a ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Shoe-maker, as he terms him in his Letter to his Wife, which he writ to her from <hi>Dover Caſtle,</hi> whither he was committed by the Parliament, part whereof (for your further ſatisfaction) I have tranſcribed, though curtail'd, you have Mr. <hi>Johns</hi> own words to his Wife.

               <p>In our Modern Hiſtories we read of ſome men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Wall-flowers for their growth, that have had the luck to be ſtrangely active in Political Affairs, ſuch as have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adventured to cut down all trees of State that have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their own proſpect, taking the Reins of the horſes of the Sun into their own hands, which in their managements of, they have either been too ſlack, or elſe pulling them too hard in, by over-winding the ſtrings of Authority, have rendred themſelves unfortunate, ſlowly perceiving the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of their ambitions, till at laſt too late they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to pluck down thoſe ſtairs by which they intended to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to their own greatneſs; ſo dangerous is an unlimitted power, a ſail too great for a veſſel of Mortality to bear, though it were never ſo well ballaſted with Juſtice, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Piety. It ſhall be my enterpriſe, void of all partiality, neither inclining to the right hand or left, ſcorning ſo much as to reflect on the flatteries, much leſs as they are under my feet, to take up any of the diſperſed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; the one party by their adulations, as the Papiſts and Puritans did <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> making him to be more then a Saint; the other deſperately malicious, as we have taken it up on Tradition from ſome Writers, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to poſterity more deformed then <hi>Richard</hi> the Third: it ſhall be my care to wave theſe petty factions, the
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:116025:282"/>flies that guilded themſelves in his ſun-ſhine, as alſo thoſe other mice, which whileſt this Martial Lion ſeemed to them to ſleep, yet without their large diſtance they durſts not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him.

               </p>
               <p>He was born at <hi>Huntington,</hi> deſcended of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Williams's,</hi> of the County of <hi>Glamorgan;</hi> and by adoption into that of the <hi>Cromwels,</hi> the more noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as deſcended of <hi>Thomas Cromwel</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the axe that hew'd down the Abbeys in the time of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
               <p>His education in his youth was for a time at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where though he attained to no great perfection in learning, yet with his other additionals, the Foxes tail with the Lions skin, his ſtrength of reaſon with the ſharp edge of his ſword, ſtood him in great ſtead in his after Tranſactions; and which, together with his indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble induſtry, rendred him ſo fortunate, that he never fell ſhort of what he undertook.</p>
               <p>After his return from the Univerſity, without any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary reſpects from the Muſes, whoſe unkindeneſs he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards moſt ſeverely retaliated, he reſolved for the future upon the firſt advantage to try the fortune of <hi>Mars;</hi> but long it was ere the blinde goddeſs provided him any action; during which time he married a Gentlewoman of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Family of the <hi>Bourchiers,</hi> (whence the Earls of <hi>Eſſex</hi> were deſcended) by whom he had two ſons which ſurvived him, <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> and three daughters, <hi>Bridget, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>Frances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his private fortunes they were competent, a medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity betwixt riches and poverty; the one blunting the edge of wit and induſtry, the other by its hardſhip whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:116025:283"/>it quite away. But what was wanting in his Eſtate was ſupplied in the greatneſs of his minde, which put him upon high attempts, which proved ſo ſucceſsful, that at laſt they placed him at the Helm of Government.</p>
               <p>He took his firſt riſe from the long Parliament, whereof he was a Member, being choſen Burgeſs for the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> in this Parliament that fire burſt forth which had been long before in kindling, that fatal diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt King and Parliament; with which laſt he wholly ſided: what motives induced him thereunto, I know not, nor will I determine of the integrity of his choice; this I am ſure of, he took the more fortunate, or by his man-hood made it ſo.</p>
               <p>When he delivered his minde in the Houſe, it was with a ſtrong and maſculine eloquence, more able to perſwade then to be perſwaded; his expreſſions were hardy, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſolute, aſſeverations grave and vehement, alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt, <hi>Andronicus</hi>-like, with Sentences of Scripture, to give them the greater weight, and the better to inſinuate into the affections of the people; he expreſſed himſelf with ſome kinde of paſſion, but with ſuch a commanding wiſe deportment, that at his pleaſure he governed and ſwayed the Houſe, as he had moſt times the leading voice.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who finde no ſuch wonders in his ſpeeches, may finde it in the effect of them; moſt of the people he was concerned in, being as they term it, enemies to book learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and whoſoever ſhould endeavour with an eloquent ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or otherwiſe go about to reconcile them, &amp; make them friends, ſhould make them enemies; ſuch great adorers are they of the Scripture phraſe, though but little practiſers; ſuch as our late times have brought forth. Indeed he uſurpt his holy oyl quotations very frequently, which was ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to his deſigns, that <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> with all their Tropes and Figures, could never have ſo perſwaded and moved the people, as he with one Text of Scripture aptly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; the Dove, and the Serpent, of Scripture, and ſome
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:116025:283"/>ſmall parcel of policy, to what he intended, ſlily intermixed.</p>
               <p>But his ſide ſtanding in more need of action then elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, he quitted the Houſe, and betook him to the Field; to manifeſt his courage as well as his eloquence, maintain by his deeds what his words had introduced.</p>
               <p>Having raiſed a Troop of Horſe at his own coſts and charges, he marched againſt the Muſes to <hi>Cambride,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was Burgeſs) ſeizing on a very conſiderable ſum of money and plate, which the Colledges had raiſed, and were ſending away unto <hi>Oxford;</hi> which as it was very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to his own ſide (money being the very life and ſinews of War) ſo d d it much weaken the adverſe party, who had alwayes great want of it. The Parliament having on their ſide the rich City of <hi>London,</hi> that inexhauſtible bank of treaſure. By this means he ſtrengthened himſelf with ſufficient aids to oppoſe the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> who was to have been ſeconded by Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and ſhould have ſeized on <hi>Cambridge,</hi> thereby to have impeded the aſſociation of the adjoyning Counties for the Parliament.</p>
               <p>He being advanced from a Captain to a Collonel, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compleated a Regiment of Horſe, to the full number of a thouſand men, in the Spring of the year, he marches to <hi>Lowerſtoft</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where he ſuddenly ſurprized Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Barker,</hi> Sir <hi>John Pettas</hi> his Brother, with above twenty other perſons of note, who were entring into an aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the King; ſeveral perſons of quality, and divers Noblemen hourly flocking to that rendezvouz, this other ſervice was very ſeaſonably rendered to the Parliament, the Kings Party both in <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being much diſcouraged by this ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Having by new raiſed aids inforced his Army to a very conſiderable ſtrength, he marched into <hi>Lilcolnſhire,</hi> with a reſolution to aſſiſt thoſe Forces which lay about <hi>Newark,</hi> a very ſtrong and ſtout Garriſon of the Kings; where, by their daily excurſions they kept all the Countrey there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:116025:284"/>in awe; which he not onely blocked up, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated part of the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Army which came to relieve them. I ſhall not need to particularize all his actions, his other intervening Atchievements are more at large related in the Life of King <hi>Charles.</hi> To look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, onely to mention the Battel of <hi>Marſton Moor,</hi> where by his valour he turned the ſcales of Victory, which at the firſt enclined to the Kings ſide; as alſo at that fatal Fight at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> where the Kings Foot were all cut in pieces or taken Priſoners. His memorable diſcomfiture of the Kings Forces at <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> over Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> and Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale;</hi> the laſt of them as valiantly faithful to the King, as the other was diſloyal: their united Forces amounting to twenty five thouſand, his not above ten thouſand at moſt; (although indeed he found little oppoſition, ſave onely of thoſe few Forces of Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdales,</hi> who fought it out courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the laſt man. Should I thus continue to ſignalize his Trophies, I might tire out the Reader with his ſtrange Succeſſes; let it ſuffice then, that his actions with ſuch fame arrived at the Houſe, that in recompence, they firſt beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him the Generalſhip of the Horſe and afterwards the Lieutenant Generalſhip of all the whole Army. Certainly if his ambition had terminated here, and his wonderful ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes had not raiſed his thoughts higher, if he could not for his Martial merits have been beloved, he had power enough to have rendred himſelf-ſafe, and for his valiant Atchievements fear'd, honour'd, and admir'd.</p>
               <p>Raiſed to this degree of Command, he was more careful of hazarding his perſon then before; well knowing the loſs of a General is the moſt irreparable of all loſſes; for him to expoſe his perſon to trivial hazards, in the breath of whoſe noſtrils the victorious Atchievements of the Souldiers remains, is too impertinently adventerous, as if 'twere more glorious to fight then command: whereas that is more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:116025:284"/>the vertue of a common Soldier, this other of a Leader, whoſe principal talent lies more in direction then executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more in the brain then hand; thus that ever to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored Laureat of our times, the Gentleman of the long Robe, the Oracle of the Kings Councels, the Lord <hi>Fauk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was as unfortunately loſt, as unneceſſarily engaged in the Field.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, he grew ſo ſubtilly careful, as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a fair correſpondency; there was no place taken, no Battle won, but he was the firſt that brought or ſent word to the Houſe; by which he inſinuated himſelf into the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections both of the Parliament and People: expreſſing his own actions in ſuch terms, as whileſt he ſeemingly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to others, he drew the whole commendation thereof to himſelf,</p>
               <p>One thing that made his Brigade ſo invincible, was his arming them ſo well, as whileſt they aſſured themſelves they could not be overcome, it aſſured them to overcome their enemies. He himſelf as they called him <hi>Ironſide,</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be aſhamed of a Nick-name that ſo often ſaved his life.</p>
               <p>Theſe were his acts whileſt Lieutenant General, by which he got ſo great a name in War, as <hi>Eſſex, Waller,</hi> and thoſe other great names before him, excepting onely Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s Laurels, which were interwoven with his, the reſt were ſwallowed up in his moſt inimitable ſucceſſes, even as great Rivers are ſwallowed up by the Ocean.</p>
               <p>For the reſt of his actions whileſt he was General, Itis conquering <hi>Ireland,</hi> his ſubduing <hi>Scotland,</hi> the many other Battles he fought till his finiſhing the War in <hi>England.</hi> To treat alſo largely of theſe his Trophies, would weary the pen of a ſerious, though induſtrious Writer, that ſadly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the incivility of thoſe late Civil Wars, howſoever they were ſtrange ſucceſſes, and ſo many, that as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Poet agrees with what I have expreſſed;</p>

               <p>I ſhall therefore ſummarily relate the moſt notable Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences then happening, leaving the leſs Affairs to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by more voluminous Authors.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were the Civil Wars of <hi>England</hi> terminated by the diſcomfiture of all the Kings Armies, the taking of his own perſon, and putting him to death: but the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a ſolemn Vote and Ordinance changed the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Government into a Commonwealth. The Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> diſcontented at this change, uniting themſelves, wned the late Kings eldeſt Son, and ſolemnly proclaimed him King, no place conſiderable ſtanding out for the Parliament ſaving onely <hi>Dublyn,</hi> and <hi>London Derry;</hi> the firſt whereof was immediately beſieged by an Army of two and twenty thouſand men, commanded by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the other by a conſiderable party of the Natives of the Countrey. To the reducing of this Kingdom was <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> nominated <hi>Governour of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the Commonwealth; who with a well appointed Army ſet ſail for <hi>Dublyn:</hi> where although he found things in an indifferent good poſture, the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond</hi> having been beaten off by the valour of <hi>Michael Jones</hi> the Governour, yet he met with work enough for his Army: for <hi>Droghedah,</hi> one of the beſt and conſiderableſt places in all <hi>Ireland,</hi> held out ſtiffly againſt them, and having a ſtrong party, bid defiance to his Army: yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after many aſſaults and much valour ſhown on both ſides he at laſt took it, putting therein to death three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Iriſh; who though enemies, yet for their valour and undaunted reſolution might have been lookt on with a more merciful eye, as they were men, and more eſpecially Chriſtians. Soon after followed the ſurrender of <hi>Trim, Dundalke, Nury, Wexford, Rove, Bandonbridge,</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale;</hi> yet notwithſtanding the reducing of theſe Towns,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:116025:285"/>many of the Iriſh retreating to their Bogs, and inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble places, held out for a long time in deſpite of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</p>
               <p>To proceed, not onely the Iriſh ſhewed their diſlike of this change of Government, but alſo the Collonies in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> and the <hi>Carybde Iſlands;</hi> to the reducing of whom the Parliament ſent Sir <hi>George Askue</hi> with a Fleet of ſhips, who brought them again into obedience.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Scots were very buſie, they had commenced a Treaty with Prince <hi>Charles</hi> at <hi>Breda,</hi> which at laſt was concluded on, he aſſenting to their Presbyterian Government; and they to inſtall and reeſtabliſh him in that Kingdom, and in the other accordingly as they queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned not but Fortune would anſwer their blinde zealous Covenant expectations.</p>
               <p>The Prince puts forth to ſea, and in deſpite of foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Engliſh King fiſhers that lay there to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him, he landed ſafely at the <hi>Spey</hi> in the North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> now though the Scots had a King, yet (as if they had none) every one did that which was right in his own eyes; and as if they intended him onely the Title, being now in their power, they forced him to follow the dictates of their haughty Cleargy, in all their fanatick humours and imperious decrees. Firſt then they bereaved him of all his old Friends, Councellours, and Confederates, whether of the Cleargy or Layety, as thoſe who adhered to Epiſcopal Government, and ſo not pure enough for ſo reformed a people. Thus they hamſtringed him not as what was formerly in the ſign-poſt onely of printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Next they make him take the <hi>Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> that ſtrange fire which the Scotch believe deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven, and by which they at their pleaſures kindle thoſe Wars wherewith they infeſt <hi>England:</hi> then theſe Horſe Farriers of the Conſcience gave him another drench; he is taught to <hi>renounce the ſins of his Fathers houſe, and of
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:116025:286"/>his own, the Idolatry of his Mother, by a conſtant adhering to the cauſe of God, according to the Covenant, in the firm eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Church Government, as it is laid down in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory for publick Worſhip, Confeſſion of Faith, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme.</hi> Theſe with divers others of the like nature, they wrought ſo on his neceſſity, they obtruded, or rather ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into his conſcience (although with much reluctancy) he ſigned to, making many ſtrange faces at theſe bitter pills he ſwallowed; yet it bettered not his condition, which was like that of a childe under Tutours and Governours; for there was not an Officer in that Kirk or Commonwealth, how vile and abject ſoever in place or perſon, but enjoyed more freedom both in body and minde then he. Guarded indeed he was, but no otherwiſe then he was ſurrounded with the <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> of their zealous ſuſpitions of him, ſo that move he muſt not but in the Sphere of the Kirk, their <hi>primum mobile:</hi> whereby its apparent, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Nation might be almoſt queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ever were truly Monarchicall, (though they had Kings.)</p>
               <p>To proceeed, the Parliament having notice of all their proceedings, recalled General <hi>Cromwell</hi> out of <hi>Ireland</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the Commonwealths Armies in the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> his ſtead, who at the ſame time laid down his Commiſſion; he with a choice Army marches into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and after many petty defeats, gives them a great overthrow at <hi>Dunbar, September</hi> 3. 1650. and proſecuting his victory takes <hi>Leith,</hi> a very conſiderable and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place, as alſo <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the Metropolitan City of all <hi>Scotland.</hi> Thus he ſet firm there his ſword, hewing his way for him to conquer that Countrey, which the King loſt by his pen.</p>
               <p>Now were the Scots truly miſerable, for beſides a raging enemy in the very heart of their Kingdom, they were miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably divided amongſt themſelves, even to the killing and
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:116025:286"/>ſlaying of one another; one party in the North, was for the King without the Kirk; another party in the Weſt, was for the Kirk without the King; a third party was for King and Kirk: yet notwithſtanding theſe loſſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, they aſſumed new courage, levyed more men, and Crowned their King with the greateſt magnificence as the indigency and neceſſity of their Affairs would permit. The Engliſh on the other ſide, being reſolved to terminate this War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> paſſed over into <hi>Fife,</hi> and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated four thouſand Scots, they ſoon became Maſters of <hi>Inchigravy Brunt-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>St. Johns Town;</hi> mean while the Scots Army conſiſting of 16000. abandoned their own Territories, and by the way of <hi>Carliſle</hi> entred <hi>England.</hi> General <hi>Cromwel</hi> advertiſed hereof, leaves Collonel <hi>Monk</hi> with 7000. men in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to perfect the conqueſt of that kingdom, and with the reſt of the Army purſues the Scots; who whereſoever they came, proclaimed their King, to be King of <hi>Great Brittain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. But few ſtirred unto their aid, amongſt others the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> who having aſſembled 1200, men in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> was defeated by Collonel <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and to ſave himſelf was conſtrained to flee to <hi>Worceſter;</hi> where the Scots after a long and tedious march, had pitched their Camp, whither General <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſoon purſued them; and having the aid of the Train Bands of ſeveral Counties, gave them Battel, which proved fatal unto the Scots; their whole Army being overthrown. The King in a diſguiſe eſcaped into <hi>France,</hi> not without much difficulty and danger; the Parliament having promiſed five hundred pounds to any one that could diſcover his perſon. Such a liſt of priſoners as were then taken, we ſhall ſeldome meet with in any Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle but <hi>Cromwels.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> General of the Scotch Army, who afterwards dyed of his wounds, the Earl of <hi>Rothe,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cornwarth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury, Packington, Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi>
                  <pb n="536" facs="tcp:116025:287"/>and <hi>Clare,</hi> Knights. The Lord <hi>Spine,</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clear,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> of <hi>Kelley,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Greaves,</hi> ſix Collonels of Horſe, thirteen of Foot, nine Lieutenant Collonels of Horſe, eight of Foot, ſix Majors of Horſe, thirteen of Foot, ſeven and thirty Captains of Horſe, ſeventy and three of Foot, fifty five Quartermaſters, eighty nine Lieutenants of Foot, Major General <hi>Biſcotty,</hi> Major General <hi>Montgomery,</hi> the Lieutenant General of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the Adjutant General of the Foot, the Marſhal General, the Quartermaſter General, the Conductor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Baggage, ſeventy ſix Standards, ninety nine Enſigns; all which were hung up in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> for ſucceſſive Parliaments to underſtand what vigour of ſpirits they by their influence can infuſe into thoſe they pleaſe to authorize, onely the want of the allay of their ambitions often works them high, where it is impoſſible to ſet limits to generous mindes. To continue the other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendixes to this victory, there were alſo taken nine Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, nine Chyrurgions, one hundred fifty and eight Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and all the Cannon and Baggage generally, the Royal Standard, the Kings Coach and Horſes, the Royal Robe, the Coller of the Order of the Garter, thirty of his domeſtique Servants, and that admirable Poet, his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Fanſhaw.</hi> Several other perſons were alſo afterwards ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the remoteſt Countries, as Major General <hi>Maſſey,</hi> (who being committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> afterwards made an eſcape,) Major General <hi>Middleton,</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>David Leſley,</hi> and ſeveral others; inſomuch as that it may be ſaid, the gleanings of this victory were as conſiderable as the whole harveſt it ſelf. Many of the common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were tranſported into the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and other Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this mercy extended to them in ſaving their lives, cauſing much gain to accrew thereby unto the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in ſelling the poor heatheniſh Highlanders to the Plantations. I ſhall onely end theſe ſad tranſactions with
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:116025:287"/>what Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> chronologized in theſe words, <hi>ſince Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Hoggs eat our dear Brethren up.</hi> He onely reflects on the half graves were made for them in <hi>Tuttle</hi> Fields.</p>
               <p>Of all this long liſt two onely ſuffered death, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Timothy Featherſtone</hi> Knight, and the Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> who on the 15. of <hi>October</hi> following was beheaded at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> being conducted thither by ſixty Foot, and eighty Horſe, about two of the Clock he was brought forth to the Scaffold, which was built at the Croſs, part of it with the Timber of his own houſe at <hi>Latham,</hi> there was not above an hundred lookers on, beſides Souldiers; preſently after his coming upon the Scaffold there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great tumult, (the occaſion thereof not being certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known,) in appeaſing of which there were ſome cut, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurt, and one childe killed. The Earl was no eloquent orator, and the tumult put him out of his ſpeaking what he intended: at laſt after ſome ſilence made, he began as followeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Since it hath pleaſed God by this untimely death to ſhorten my dayes, I am glad it is in this Town, (where ſome have been made believe I was a cruel perſon) that I might vindicate my ſelf from this aſperſion, it was my deſire the laſt time I came into this Countrey, to come hither as to a people that ought to ſerve the King, as I conceive, upon good grounds: it was ſaid, that I was accuſtomed to be a man of blood, but it doth not lie upon my conſcience, I was wrongfully bely'd; I thank God I deſired peace. I was born in honour, and I ſhall dye honourably, as I ſuffer for my Sovereign. I had a fair eſtate, good friends, and was reſpected, and did reſpect; thoſe that were ready to do for me, I was ready to do for them; I have done nothing, but as my generous predeceſſors acted to do you good. It was the King that called me in, and I thought it my duty to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Highneſs to do him ſervice.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Here he was diſturbed by the noiſe of the people, after ſome pauſe he ſaid; <hi>I intended to have expreſt my ſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:116025:288"/>but I have ſaid. I have not much more to ſay to you, but as to my good will to this Town of</hi> Bolton, <hi>I can ſay no more, but the Lord bleſs you, I forgive you all, and deſire to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given of you all, for I put my truſt in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Looking about him he ſaid, <hi>I did never deſerve this hard meaſure. Honeſt friends (you that are Souldiers) my life is taken away after quarter given, by a Councel of War, which was never done before.</hi> Walking up and down the Scaffold, he ſaid, <hi>The Lord bleſs you all, the Son of God bleſs you all of this Town of</hi> Bolton, Mancheſter, Lancaſhire, <hi>and the reſt of the kingdom; and God ſend that you may have a King again, and Laws. I dye like a Chriſtian, and a Souldier, Gods and my Sovereigns Souldier.</hi> Cauſing his Coffin to be opened, he ſaid, <hi>I hope when I am impriſoned here, armed men ſhall not need to watch me.</hi> Looking upon them that were upon the Scaffold, he ſaid, <hi>What do you ſtay for? it is hard that I cannot get a Block to have my head cut off.</hi> Speaking to the Executioner, he ſaid, <hi>Thy coat is ſo troubleſome and cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that I believe that thou canſt not hit right, the Lord help thee, and forgive thee.</hi> Other words he uſed, which to avoid prolixity I willingly omit. At laſt ſubmitting his neck to the Block, he had his head ſevered from his body with one blow; his ſorrowful Son, who was a ſad ſpectator of this woful tragedy, out of a pious care, and filial duty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed his Corps back with him that night to <hi>Wiggan,</hi> and afterwards gave them honourable burial.</p>
               <p>Not long before at <hi>London</hi> was Collonel <hi>Euſebius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> apprehended, who having formerly practiced the Law, changed his Gown into a Coat of Armour, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured his life in the Kings ſervice, having received a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King of Scots, for the raiſing men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he was tryed in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> at the High Court of Juſtice, then again newly erected, being the firſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Gentleman that hanſelled the Court. To paſs over the large particulars of tryal he was acknowledged by all
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:116025:288"/>that were underſtanding Auditours of his Plea, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf like to a right Engliſh man, ſpoke as good, ſound, and as honeſt ſenſe, as any perſon before him upon ſuch limitations as he was confined too; he ſhewed himſelf an excellent Oratour, an expert Lawyer, and a perſon of ſtrong and clear reaſon: he acknowledged himſelf guilty as to the power of that preſent Government, that his life was at their diſpoſal. He was condemned, and the 22. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1650. brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> where he expreſſed himſelf to the people in theſe his laſt words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtian Gentlemen and People, your buſineſs hither to day is to ſee a ſad ſpectacle, a man to be in a moment unman'd, and cut off in the prime of his years, taken from further opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing good either to himſelf, his friends, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or more eſpecially as to my continued ſervices to my Creatour. Truly, if my general known courſe of life were but enquired into, I may modeſtly ſay, there is ſuch a moral honeſty upon it, as ſome may be ſo ſawcy as to expoſtulate why this great judgement is fallen upon me; but know I am able to give them and my ſelf an anſwer, and out of this breaſt am able to give a better accompt of my Judgement and Execution then my Judgers themſelves, or you are able to give: It is Gods wrath upon me for ſins long unrepented of, many judgements withſtood, and mercies ſlighted; therefore God hath whipped me by his ſevere Rod of Correction, that he might not loſe me. I pray joyn with me in prayer, that it may not be a fruicleſs Rod, that when by this Rod I have laid down my life, by his ſtaff I may be comforted and received into Glory. I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by what I have heard ſince my ſentence, there is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions made againſt proceedings againſt me, then I ever made. My Triers had a Law, and the value of that Law is indiſputable; and for me to make a queſtion of it, I ſhould ſhame my ſelf and my diſcretion. In the ſtrictneſs of that Law, ſomething is done by me, that is applicable to ſome clauſe
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:116025:289"/>therein, by which I ſtand condemnable: The means whereby I was brought under that interpretation of that which was not in my ſelf intended malitiouſly, there being teſtimony given (by perſons whom I pitty) ſo falſe, yet ſo poſitive, that I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn my Judges, for paſſing ſentence againſt me, according to Legal Juſtice, though Equity lieth in the higher breaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for my Accuſers, or rather Betrayers, I pitty, and am ſorry for them; they have committed</hi> Judas <hi>crime, but I wiſh and pray for them with</hi> Peters <hi>tears, that by</hi> Peters <hi>repentance they may eſcape</hi> Judas <hi>his puniſhment; and I wiſh other people ſo happy, they may be taken up betimes, before they have drunk more blood of Chriſtian men, poſſibly leſs deſerving then my ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is true, there have been ſeveral addreſſes made for mercy, and I will put the obſtruction of it upon nothing more then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my own ſin; and ſeeing God ſees it fit, (having not glorified him in my life) I might do it in my death, which I am content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do; I profeſs in the fear of God, particular malice to any one of State or Parliament, to do them a bodily injury I had none.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the cauſe in which I had long waded, I muſt needs ſay, my engagement or continuance in it hath laid no ſcruple upon my Conſcience; it was on Principles of Law, the knowledge whereof I profeſs, and on principles of Religion: my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſatisfied, and Conſcience rectified, that I have purſued thoſe wayes which I bleſs God I finde no blackneſs upon my conſcience, nor have I put it into the Bead-roll of my ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will not preſume to decide controverſies; I deſire God to honour himſelf in proſpering that ſide that hath right with it, and that you may enjoy peace and plenty, beyond all you poſſeſs here. In my Converſation in the world, I do not know where I have an enemy with cauſe, or that there is ſuch a perſon whom I have to regret but if there be any whom I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, under the notion of Chriſtian men, I pardon them as freely as if I had named them by name, I freely forgive them,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:116025:289"/>being in free peace with all the world, as I deſire God for Chriſts ſake, to be at peace with me. For the buſineſs of death it is a ſad ſentence in it ſelf, if men conſult with fleſh and blood: But truly without booſting, I ſay it, or if I do boaſt, I boaſt in the Lord, I have not to this minute had one conſultation with the fleſh about the blow of the Axe, or one thought of the Axe, more then as my paſsport to Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I take it for an honour, and I owe thankfulneſs to thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe power I am, that they ſent me hither to a place, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of puniſhment, yet of ſome honor, to dye a death ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worthy of my blood, anſwerable to my birth and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and this courteſie of theirs hath much helped towards the pacification of my minde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſhall deſire God that thoſe Gentlemen in that ſad Bead-roll to be tryed by the High Court of Juſtice, that they may find that really there, that is nominal in the Act, an High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, a Court of High Juſtice, high in its Righteouſneſs, though not in its ſeverity. Father forgive them, and forgive me as I forgive them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I deſire you now that you would pray for me, and not give over praying till the hour of my death, not till the moment of my death, for the hour is come already, the inſtant of time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, that as I have a great load of ſins, ſo I may have the wings of your prayers, to help thoſe Angels that are to convey my ſoul to Heaven; and I doubt not but I ſhall ſee my</hi> Saviour, <hi>and my gallant Maſter</hi> the King of England, <hi>and another Maſter whom I much honoured,</hi> my Lord <hi>Capel, hoping this day to ſee my</hi> Chriſt <hi>in the preſence of the</hi> Father, <hi>the</hi> King <hi>in the preſence of him, my Lord</hi> Capel <hi>in the preſence of them all; and my</hi> ſelf <hi>there to rejoyce with all other Saints and Angels for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>After the uttering of theſe and many the like words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his faith and confidence in God, with as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, yet Chriſtian courage, as poſſibly could be in man, he expoſed his neck to the fatal Axe, commending his ſoul
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:116025:290"/>into the hands of a faithful and merciful Creatour, through the meritorious Paſſion of a gracious Redeemer; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive me,</hi> the Executioner with one blow ſevered his head from his body.</p>
               <p>For ſuch a collateral deſign, not long after one Maſter <hi>Benſon</hi> was executed at <hi>Tyburne,</hi> one that had ſome relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> who was tried for the ſame Conſpiracy, with his man: Sir <hi>Johns</hi> former ſervices to the Parliament, being his beſt and moſt aſſured interceſſours for his life, and at that time were more then ordinary advantages to him.</p>
               <p>And now being entered into this Tragical Scene of blood, I ſhall in the next place give you an account of the beheading of Sir <hi>Henry Hide:</hi> He was by the <hi>Scots</hi> King commiſſionated as Ambaſſadour to the Grand <hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſtood in competition with Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bendiſh</hi> (then Ambaſſadour for the Engliſh) for his place: whereupon they had a hearing before the <hi>Vizier Baſſa;</hi> the reſult whereof was, that Sir <hi>Thomas Bendiſh</hi> ſhould diſpoſe of the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Hide,</hi> as he thought good; who was to the ſame purpoſe ſent to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> thence into <hi>England,</hi> and there condemned and executed before the <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> in <hi>London, March</hi> 4. 1650. I have inſerted his Speech, which reflects on his Tranſactions; this unfortunate Gentlemans end, being by the divine diſpoſal, from the foregoing part of his life as ſtrange as ever I have read in Hiſtory. His laſt words were to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtian People, I come hither to dye, I am brought hither to dye; and that I may dye Chriſtian like, I humbly beſeech the aſſiſtance of your Chriſtian prayers, that by the benefit of them my paſſage may be the more eaſie: Yet becauſe men in that condition, which it hath pleaſed God to reduce me to, give the more credit to Speech; in the diſcharge of my duty towards God, I ſhall uſe a few words, and ſo conclude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="543" facs="tcp:116025:290"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I pray all of you joyn with me to praiſe this Almighty God, to whom I deſire to render all hearty thanks; as for all his mercies, ſo in particular for this, that he hath brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that whereas I owe a debt to ſin and to nature, that now I can pay the debt to nature, I can pay it upon the account of Grace. And becauſe it is fit to render the bleſſed account of that hope that is in me, I ſhall tell you, to the praiſe of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that I have been born and bred up in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>I have no negative Religion, believing to be ſaved by the onely merits of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and whatſoever elſe is profeſt in the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>authorized by Law; humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Almighty God to reſtore unto this Church her peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and patrimony, whereof I have been an obedient and a loving (however an unworthy) Son: and now both my hope being confident, and my faith perfected, there remains onely Chriſtian Charity; Charity we carry into heaven, Charity on earth, that I leave; beſeeching all whomſoever I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended to forgive me, as I from the bottom of my heart do all whomſoever; bleſſing Almighty God for the happy advantage he takes to bring me the ſooner to heaven; I bleſs Almighty God that he hath given me this advantage, as he hath been merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me before the foundation of the world, in my Saviour, ſo that now he hath in mercy honoured me, with a ſuffering for his name, in obedience to his Commandment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On this day ſevennight I was ſummoned before that Juſtice, which condemned me on Friday laſt, praiſed be Almighty God, that by this way he hath brought me nearer to himſelf. My charge I preſume is publick as my puniſhment is viſible; if there have been any thing in the management of my part, being unskilful, having diſcontinued my own countrey many years, I ſhall beſeech the Chriſtian Charity of all you my beloved Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, to impute it rightly to the ignorance of my unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wayes of managing of affairs: it was objected unto me there, that I had a vanity of delighting in ſtrange tongues; I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:116025:291"/>that I was beſt skilled in the Italian (but free from that vanity, I thank Almighty God) and therefore I would in defence of my life (if it had been the cuſtom here, or the Judges favour) have uſed that language, which was almoſt as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to me as my mother tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was objected, that I did not ſo freely as a thorow-paced Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, own my Maſter: I was told ſince I came into</hi> England <hi>(this skill I have in our Laws) that a legal denyal in Law might be tollerable; I hope I did not exceed the bounds of that in any thing, for God forbid that I ſhould be aſhamed of ſerving ſo good, ſo pious, ſo juſt a Maſter;</hi> (putting off his hat) <hi>for this I rejoyce, and I humbly beſeech Almighty God to fill my heart and my tongue, and all that hear me this day, with thankfulneſs for it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <q>As to the buſineſs, that another conſtruction had been made and believed here, then what was there, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God knoweth it; if any weakneſs were in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, that was mine: I was ſent to ſerve and protect, not to injure any, as God acquits me of the intention of matter of fact, as having not done any manner of evil that way, however here underſtood, bleſſed be his holy name (again putting off his hat) ſo thoſe Gentlemen of the Turky Company, if they would might acknowledge, for they know it very well, the impoſſibility of my doing them any manner of harm. Whereas that of the Embaſſy objected againſt me, that my Maſter honoured me with it, though I was never worthy of it; I was his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger and <hi>Internuntio</hi> for the conſervation onely of his good Subjects, of all the Merchants, untill ſuch time as he could confirme that Gentlemen now Reſident, or to ſend any other; and they themſelves know that there was an unpoſſibility (as I bleſs God there was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in me) unto any ſuch intention to do them harm; for my Maſters commands were point blank the contrary: I was onely ſent for their good; as I never
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:116025:291"/>owned the title, ſo the very letters themſelves ſpeaking no other: I never did ſo much as think of any manner of addreſs to the Grand Signior, but gave him the letter from my Maſter; the reſt of the Engliſh Nation that were there preſent, may, when they pleaſe, aſſert ſo much. This I would inſert, that thoſe Gentlemen, as they have been loſers by the miſcarriages of others, may now have a breach of their charity with me; but if it be, as it ſeems it is now in this Countrey, a ſin to be loyal, I hope my God hath forgiven that, when it is upon harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs employment, not invading any, according to my juſt Maſters order; for indeed I have been alwayes bred up in the Religion of Loyalty, my Allegiance hath been incorporated into my Religion, and I have thought it a great part of the ſervice due from me to Almighty God, to ſerve the King (again putting off his hat.) He ſaid, I need not make any apology for any thing in relation to the preſent Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> for were I (as I ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formy Judges) were I as evil as my ſentence here hath made me black, it were impoſſible for me to have preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced any body in <hi>England,</hi> or to <hi>England</hi> belonging, in that employment; but I bleſs God for his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Jeſus Chriſt, who hath taken me to himſelf by this manner of way, it was the beſt Phyſick for the curing of my ſoul, and thoſe that have done it, have no more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then that of my body; I leave nothing behinde me, but that I am willing to part withal; all that I am going to, is deſirable: and that you may all know that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath wrought in me a total denyal of my ſelf, and that there is that perfect reformation of me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, of my own corruptions, by the bleſſed aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirit; I deſire Almighty God in the abundance of the bowels of his mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, not onely to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give every enemy, (if any ſuch be in the world, here or whereſoever) but to bring him into his boſom, ſo much
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:116025:292"/>good and particular comfort, as he may at any time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cauſe were juſt or unjuſt, have wiſhed me any manner of evil; for I take him to be the happy inſtrument of bringing me to heaven. I am tedious, but I have an inward comfort, I bleſs Almighty God: (pray Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men give leave, ſpeaking to ſome that preſt upon him) I ſhould never do it but to give ſatisfaction to all charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearts. I have been troubleſome.</q>
               <p>Here he made a pauſe, as diſcontented at the diſturbance of thoſe on the Scaffold, when the Sheriff ſaid to him, <hi>Sir, you have your liberty to ſpeak more if you pleaſe,</hi> at length he proceeded.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But as to that part, Mr. Sheriff, that did concern the denyal (as it was affirmed by Maſter Atturney General) of my Maſters employment; truly, landing at <hi>White Hall,</hi> I told that Councel, there was warrantable Commiſſions to an old Officer, which by the bleſſing of God, I have by me, and I have other acceptable things that God hath bleſſed me withal; we that are Merchants abroad, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our ſelves any ſufferance that may induce to our own ſafety, inlargement of trade, or preſervation of what is ours. Why I had by the favour of my gracious Maſter, a confirmation of my old Commiſſion of <hi>Conſulage</hi> in <hi>Greece:</hi> but as to the Embaſſy, no more then my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Letters did ſpeak, nor no more then that I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, an <hi>Internuncio</hi> they call it in thoſe places, which is a meſſenger between the one and the other King, they both unhappily dyed of ſeveral deaths, and both violent too: and it is a cuſtom not unknown to you, Maſter Sheriff, and other Gentlemen that practiſe in the world, that Princes of courſe, for the continuation of amity do ſend meſſengers where there is peace, that the tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe publick expreſſions of reciprocal affections may be performed; but for Embaſſy, God forbid I ſhould own it, I never had it, however they have uſed it as the
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:116025:292"/>happy means to bring me to God this day, whom I in the Bowels of my Saviour beſeech to forgive thoſe people that have done it; I owe them no harme, God return better things into their boſoms with all the good of this, and an everlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>As for my part, I have been long abſent, I have med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with no affairs in <hi>England;</hi> ſufficient to me is Gods grace to the ſalvation of my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>I have been alwayes fearful of offending Almighty God, according to the grace he hath given me: but to learn a new Religion, or new wayes, (that I muſt ſay Mr. Sheriff to you, and all others that hear me) I could never diſpenſe with my conſcience to give offence to Almighty God. I am now (if it may be with your Commiſſion Maſter Sheriff) to pour out my ſoul to Almighty God in two or three words (the place is ſtraitned) if I knew wherein to give any ſatisfaction to any perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that imagines I have offended him, or he me, I am here in the fear of God to do it. I forgive them with all my ſoul, and my forgiveneſs is clear, as I am now going to receive happineſs at the hand of my Saviour: if I thought it were ſatisfaction to Sir <hi>Thomas Bendiſh,</hi> and all the company, or any who think they have offended me. I am come, Maſter Sheriff, to pay that debt I owe to nature, to pay it upon the ſcore of a Loyal Subject; my conſcience within me informing me, that for the intentions of ſerving my Prince, I could not deſerve ſuch a death, though ten thouſand times more other wayes.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Having expreſſed himſelf to this effect with much meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſubmitted his neck to the Axe, having firſt ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſoul,</hi> the Executioner at one blow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his head from his body.</p>
               <p>Not long after <hi>Brown Buſhel</hi> was beheaded under the Scaffold on <hi>Tower Hill,</hi> one who had formerly done great ſervice to the Royal Party both by Sea and Land; crimes
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:116025:293"/>of ſuch a nature, as brought him into compaſs of Piracy, and then of high Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe Funerals were ſtill accompanied with more mourners. Soon after enſuing the deaths of Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> who were beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill</hi> the 22. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1651. their Crimes objected, were, for combining with the Scots to reeſtabliſh <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi> Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> Tryal, with his Speech, and manner of his death, are in a large printed volume, to which I refer my Reader; all that I ſhall inſert, will be no more then what hath been by another already obſerved in print, that there was a monſtrous ſtorm about the time of Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> ſuffering, another about the time of the Protectors death; that Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> though with a late aſſent to Regal power, ſuffered as a Presbyterian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; Doctor <hi>Hewit</hi> as one alwayes eſtabliſht and confirmed as a Primitive; after whoſe Execution within a ſhort time after, great <hi>Cromwel</hi> expired: many others were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſame account, but theſe two onely ſuffered.</p>
               <p>Paſſing over theſe Golgotha's, the reader may be pleaſed to underſtand, that all theſe perſons here mentioned, (ſave onely the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi>) ſuffered death before that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Battel at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> though in our Hiſtory we have related them after, as not willing to diſcontinue the ſeries of our affairs with <hi>Scotland</hi> by ſuch diverſions. I ſhall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſert without any reflection what I have read, of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon remarkable for his cruelties, that he, being told of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Leiger Star of heaven, that one ſaid portended his death; anſwered, <hi>That he was very glad that the heavens were ſo merry as to make Bonefires for his triumph before he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> This miſcreant entertaining this for a Maxime, that he that had put out ſo many eyes, if he ſtood in need ſhould ſcarcely finde a friend to cloſe up his own. But to return to matters of more publick concernment, the Iſles of <hi>Jerſey, Jernſy,</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> who had hitherto held for the King, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves; ſo that now all ſeemed quiet, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:116025:293"/>a War brake forth with <hi>Holland,</hi> begun onely at firſt upon points of, Honour at Sea, <hi>Van Trump</hi> the Dutch Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral refuſing to vail his Flag, a Ceremonial Honour which the Engliſh appropriate to themſelves, as being Lords of theſe narrow Seas; whereupon a ſharp Fight enſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, wherein the Dutch were diſcomfited, one of their ſhips ſunk, and another of thirty Guns taken, with the Captains of both, and about a hundred and fifty Priſoners.</p>
               <p>This Skirmiſh produced open War betwixt the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, notwithſtanding Overtures of Peace made by the Hollander, ſo that now both ſides prepare to offend each other. General <hi>Blake,</hi> the Engliſh Admiral ſurprizes twelve Dutch men of War towards the Iſles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> Sir <hi>George Aſcue</hi> in the Road betwixt <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calice,</hi> ſets upon their Fleet, being thirty in number, of which ten were taken and burnt, the reſt hardly eſcaping. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter near <hi>Plimouth</hi> he gave them another fight, wherein the Dutch went again by the worſt. Theſe ſucceſſes were ſeconded by others very remarkable, General <hi>Blake</hi> ſteering Northwards, took ſix Holland ſhips of a great value about the <hi>Downes.</hi> Captain <hi>Penne</hi> alſo took ſix more upon the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> as they were returning homewards from the Venetian ſervice, richly laden being all men of War, of conſiderable burthens.</p>
               <p>Soon after ſo great their feud was, that the Navies enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in another Fight at a place called the <hi>Kentiſh Knock,</hi> wherein the Dutch were again defeated, eleven of their men of War ſet upon four of the Engliſh in the <hi>Straights,</hi> took the Phenix Frigot, and much damaged the other. In a ſhort ſpace after another Sea Engagement enſued on the Back-ſide of <hi>Goodwin Sands,</hi> wherein the Engliſh were worſted, four ſhips taken and a conſiderable loſs of men. The greateſt fight of all was near the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> and <hi>Portland,</hi> wherein the Dutch received a great overthrow,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:116025:294"/>fifty Merchants being taken, nine men of War, above two thouſand ſlain, and fifteen hundred taken Priſoners. But this great Victory ſoon after received a check, the Engliſh Fleet in the Levant Seas being again worſted by the Dutch, with the loſs of divers ſhips and men.</p>
               <p>But leaving off theſe Sea Affairs for a time, let us come to General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> from whom I have already been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to digreſs; who pretending for the better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of his own deſigns, the dilatory proceedings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and arbitrary actings in the Parliament, to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate their Seſſion, to be very dangerous, and enthrall the Nation; this train of his he knew would take well with the people who were great adorers of the name of liberty and deſirous of change; he therefore reſolved to put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the Parliament, and accordingly accompanied by the chief Officers of the Army, he entered the Houſe, and having declared his intentions, ſome by force, ſome through fear, and others not without a great deal of reluctancy and murmuring, departed the Houſe. To ſet a fair gloſs upon what he had done, and to give ſome ſatisfaction to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he publiſhes a Declaration, the ſubſtance whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That after God was pleaſed marvellouſly to appear for his people, in reducing <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſo great a peace, and <hi>England</hi> to perfect quiet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Parliament had opportunity to give the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the harveſt of all their labour, blood, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and to ſettle a due liberty in reference to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Spiritual things: whereunto they were obliged by their duty, engagements, and thoſe great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things God hath wrought for them. But they made ſo little progreſs therein, that it was matter of much grief to the good people of the Land; who thereupon applied themſelves to the Army, expecting redreſs by their means, who (though unwilling to meddle with the
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:116025:294"/>Civil Authority) agreed that ſuch Officers as were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament ſhould move them to proceed vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, in reforming what was amiſs in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and in ſettling it upon a foundation of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs; which being done, it was hoped the Parliament would have anſwered their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>But finding the contrary, they renewed their deſires by an humble Petition in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1652. which produced no conſiderable effects, nor was any ſuch progreſs made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as might imply their real Intentions to accompliſh what was petitioned for; but rather an averſeneſs to the things themſelves, with much bitterneſs and oppoſition to the people of God, and his ſpirit acting in them: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that the godly party in Parliament were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of no further uſe, then to countenance the ends of a corrupt party, for effecting their deſires of perpetuating themſelves in the ſupream Government.</p>
                  <p>For obviating theſe evils, the Officers of the Army obtained ſeveral meetings with ſome of the Parliament, to conſider what remedy might be applied to prevent the ſame; but ſuch endeavours proving ineffectual, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came evident, that this Parliament, through the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſome, the jealouſie of others, the non-atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of many, would never anſwer thoſe ends which God, his people, and the whole Nation expected from them: But that this cauſe which God had ſo greatly bleſſed, muſt needs languiſh under their hands, and by degrees be loſt; and the lives, liberties, and comforts of his people be delivered into their enemies hands.</p>
                  <p>All which being ſadly and ſeriouſly conſidered by the honeſt people of the Nation, as well as by the Army, it ſeemed a duty incumbent upon us, who had ſeen ſo much of the power and preſence of God, to conſider of ſome effectual means whereby to eſtabliſh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:116025:295"/>and Peace in theſe Nations.</p>
                  <p>And after much debate it was judged neceſſary, that the Supream Government ſhould be by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment devolved upon known perſons fearing God, and of approved integrity for a time, as the moſt hopeful way to countenance all Gods people, reform the Law, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Juſtice impartially: hoping thereby the people might forget Monarchy, and underſtand their true intereſt in the election of ſucceſſive Parliaments; that ſo the Government might be ſettled upon a right Baſis, without hazard to this glorious cauſe, or neceſſitating to keep up Armies for the defence of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And being ſtill reſolved to uſe all means poſſibly to avoid extraordinary courſes, we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament, to give us a conference, with whom we plainly debated the neceſſity and juſtneſs of our Propoſals: The which found no acceptance, but inſtead thereof it was offered, that the way was to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill this Parliament, as being that from which we might probably expect all good things. This being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently inſiſted on, did much confirm us in our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions: That not any love to a Repreſentative, but the making uſe thereof to recruit, and ſo to perpetuate themſelves, was their aim, in the Act they had then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration.</p>
                  <p>For preventing the conſummating whereof, and all the ſad and evil conſequences, which upon the grounds afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid muſt have enſued, and whereby at one blow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of all honeſt men and of this glorious Cauſe had been endangered to be laid in the duſt, and theſe Nations embroyled in new troubles, at a time when our enemies abroad are watching all advantages againſt, and ſome of them actually engaged in War with us; we have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated (though with much reluctancy) to put an end to this Parliament.</p>

               <p>Certainly Parliaments, if rightly choſen, are the beſt phyſick to cure and redreſs the diſtempers of the Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, which might overflow in their intervals.

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:116025:296"/>ſhould never have known. His Son afterwards diſſolved three, whereof one of them proved fatal to him; whereas the Virgin Queen, that was well enough acquainted with the conſtitution of the Body of the Nation, called Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments frequently, but continued none very long, by which as ſhe came to be Miſtreſs of the affections of the people, ſo ſhe was Commandreſs in chief of their purſes.

               <p>Theſe domeſtick revolutions put new life into the Dutch, who hoping from theſe diſtractions to reap a Victory over the Engliſh, with great confidence put forth again to Sea; thinking upon nothing ſo much as Chapmen for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Fleet, ſaying: <hi>It was to be cried out by the ſound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and horns.</hi> But they were deceived in their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for coming to a fight, on the North Foreland, near unto the South point of the <hi>Gober,</hi> their Fleet was defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eleven men of War, and two water Hoyes being taken, beſides ſix Captains and fifteen hundred Priſoners, and ſix men of War which were ſunk.</p>
               <p>Certainly this War with the Dutch which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo ſucceſſively drove on, had not without great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages been ended by them, onely the Protectour at the preſent, as a leading Card to his other Treaties, entertained the Dutch tenders, he being forced to take the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſignalize his Honour, as alſo to pleaſe the more timerous ſort of people with a ſudden alliance of friends.</p>

                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> calls another Parliament convened at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who met <hi>July</hi> 4. 1653. to whom Generall <hi>Cromwel</hi> made a long ſpeech, <hi>declaring the wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God towards this Nation, the progreſs of Affairs ſince the famous Victory at</hi> Worceſter, <hi>and the clearneſs of the Cull given them to take upon them the Supream Authority,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with ſundry phraſes of Scripture to make it the more plauſible. Then he produced an Inſtrument under his own Hand and Seal, whereby the Supream Authority of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was devolved upon them, unto whom all perſons were to yield obedience and ſubjection. He declared that they were to ſit no longer then the third of <hi>November</hi> 1654. and three moneths before their diſſolution they were to make choice of other perſons to ſucceed them, who were not to ſit above twelve moneths, and then to take care for a ſucceſſion in Government.</p>
               <p>Now was the time come for the train to take the Dutch, having, as hath been expreſſed, caſt the urine of the preſent Affairs, being quite tired with their continual loſſes, ſent Commiſſioners over into <hi>England</hi> to treat of Peace. It hath been the reſult of the opinions of thoſe that had their eyes in their heads, that the Dutch thought to have made up their mouths, to have taken our Navy napping in the time of the Treaty, the Fight happening betwixt them and us; but they found it otherwiſe, their whole Fleet was put to flight, their Admiral <hi>Van Trump,</hi> a man of eminent va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour being ſlain, about thirty men of War ſunk and fired, ſix Captains, and about a thouſand men taken priſoners, and about ſix thouſand ſlain. This great Victory did not a little conduce to haſten the concluſion of the peace, but on ſuch terms as were (as one writes) at that time more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for his preſent deſigns, then advantageous to the Engliſh Nation. For this ſervice, gold chains were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Generals, <hi>Blake, Monk, Penne,</hi> and <hi>Lawſon,</hi>
                  <pb n="556" facs="tcp:116025:297"/>and to the other Flag Captains; and ſilver Medals to the other Officers of the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Of the puiſſance of our Navies, and the Dominion of the Engliſh at Sea, accept what the Laureat of this Nation to the life expreſſes.</p>

               <p>To reckon up the ſeveral opinions which about this time, like <hi>Hydra's</hi> heads, continually ſprung up one upon the neck of another, were a task <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and thoſe of ſeveral kindes; ſome for impoſition of hands, anointing with oyl,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:116025:297"/>and waſhing of feet; ſome againſt them, Browniſts; others, Millinarians, Arminians, Seekers, Ranters, Enthuſiaſts, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Pelagians, Quakers, <hi>cum multis aliis,</hi> of all which, I ſhall onely ſay thus much, <hi>God knows his own time, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Tares and the Wheat to grow together till Harveſt;</hi> there ought to be a great care, leaſt in plucking up the tares we pull up the wheat; we ought not to invade mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences but to wait God Almighties leaſure.</p>
               <p>The Parliament having ſat about as many weeks as the other had done years, they diſſolved themſelves, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately making way for General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> by their diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be choſen Lord Protector of the Common-wealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of all the Iſlands and Territories thereunto belonging, <hi>December</hi> the 16. 1653. Thus all men in their right wits may perceive how he laid down his firſt principles of ſelf-denying; he having before waved many advantages of the times to make certain his Protectorſhip, which was to graſp all at once. The Articles of the Government to which he ſigned are as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That his Excellency be chief Protector of the three Nations of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. That there ſhall be every three years a Parliament called, freely choſen, to begin in <hi>September</hi> next, <hi>viz.</hi> four hundred, and the number for every County proportionable.</p>

               <p n="6">6. When ever any Bill is paſſed in Parliament, the Lord Protector ſhall have twenty dayes to adviſe with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel; if he ſign it not in twenty dayes, it ſhall paſs without, unleſs contrary to theſe Articles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That no Parliament be diſſolved by the Protector, but
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:116025:298"/>end every three years, and the Protector to iſſue out War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</p>
               <p n="8">8. All the Crown Revenues left, to go to the maintenance of the Lord Protector.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To make Peace or War as he pleaſeth, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Councel, in the intervall of Parliaments; but not to raiſe money without the Parliament, unleſs in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cauſes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Whatſoever goes out in the name of the <hi>Keepers of the Liberties of</hi> England, to go out in the name of the <hi>Lord Protector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. That it is treaſon to ſpeak againſt the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That all forfeited and confiſcated Eſtates go to the maintenance of the Lord Protector.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That all Acts of Parliament made, and Eſtates ſold, ſtand good and be enjoyed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. That the Lord Protector have power to confer ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Honour, and to diſpoſe of the great places of truſt.</p>
               <p n="15">15. That in the intervall of Parliaments, the Lord prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, with his Councel, do order the Affairs of the Nation.</p>
               <p n="16">16. That all Articles of War be kept.</p>
               <p n="17">17. That the known Laws of the Common-wealth be continued.</p>
               <p n="18">18. That a ſtanding Army be maintained of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and twenty thouſand Foot.</p>
               <p n="19">19. That Chriſtian Religion be maintained, ſuch as is contained in the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="20">20. That all perſons ſhall have Liberty of Conſcience, provided that they diſturb not the Civil Government, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Popiſh and Prelatical party.</p>
               <p n="21">21. That no Papiſt or Delinquent in Arms ſince the year 1649. elect, or be elected, a Parliament Man, under penalty of forfeiture of one years revenue, and the Moie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his perſonal Eſtate.</p>
               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:116025:298"/>
               <p n="22">22. That the Lord Protector have power to pardon all offenders, except Murther.</p>
               <p n="23">23. That Writs be iſſued out in <hi>July</hi> next for ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parliament, either by the Protector, or in courſe.</p>
               <p n="24">24. That when the Protector dyes, the Council then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhall ſummon all the members of the Council, the Major part to elect one to be Protector before they ſtir out of the Council Chamber, and the perſon ſo choſen, not to be under the age of twenty one years, nor of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Articles ſworn to, he was proclaimed Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in the <hi>Palace-yard</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and by the Lord Major and Aldermen in their Scarlet Gowns at the <hi>Royal Exchange;</hi> who to ingratiate themſelves with their new Governour, beſtowed on him a coſtly feaſt at <hi>Grocers Hall:</hi> it is an uſual obſervation that perſons that make their wayes with their Swords, that their ſhows to take the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, generally are more ſtately then thoſe of ſucceſſive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; what he admitted of, as with his own permiſſion, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thoſe dutiful ſolemnities that purſued his memory; without diſpute he had ſtudied the art and ordinance of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying, inſomuch that the Parliament perceiving that he did but complement his Generalſhip, which he might with fafety and moſt right have accepted, they preſſed him the leſs, as he ſeemed to puſh away that with his little finger that they were certain he was ready to graſp with both his hands: this was not ſo miraculous in him according to that of <hi>Ovid.</hi>

               <p>The greateſt admiration that hath ſurpriſed me, hath bin what in the compaſs of a year I have obſerved, the tides and ſtreams of petitions out of moſt Counties, that at the firſt riſe or promiſe of greatneſs have purſued every alteration, as party-coloured as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Coat, and as variable as the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:116025:299"/>Rainbow; it is not to be depictured how <hi>Janus</hi>-faced they have been on all occaſions, with how many religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and wiſhes they have made their addreſſes and maſqued their ſelf-intereſts, if it were poſſible in ſo ſhort an interim of time, at once adoring ſo many riſing Suns. I ſhall reflect no otherwiſe on ſuch confuſed tranſactions, then in the citation of a Verſe which the Reader may underſtand as he pleaſes.</p>

                  <l>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the chief of all the rout,</l>

               </q>
               <p>Since I have ſo ſtrangely digreſſed, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to take notice of a book lately come forth, intituled, <hi>Hiſtory and Policy reviewed,</hi> concerning the political tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Protector, publiſht in a ſtrange name, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the ſtile of the holy Court, in which, the Author un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes a prodigious enterpriſe, to compare <hi>Cromwel</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> his pen is too palpably fraught with flattery, yet not without unparalleld ſubtilty; he having like the little Indian Gentleman, in the ſhort jacket, pickt the vermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of <hi>Nic. Machiavels</hi> head for his uſe; throwing of one ſide principals honeſter then this own; <hi>Machiavel</hi> never ſo diſguiſing himſelf with the vizard of Religion, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be an arranter devil then the <hi>Florentine;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am, that I never read a book that more pleaſed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed me.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, at his firſt inſtalment, <hi>Heavens bleſs us,</hi> immediately follows a plot, miraculouſly diſcovered, eleven of the grand conſpirators being apprehended, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Tower;</hi> where having remained a while, they were again ſet at liberty. This web was not well ſpun, his ſpies and informers which he entertained at a vaſt expence, put on their ſpectacles that they might ſee better againſt the next occaſion.</p>
               <p>In the interim, the Scots under the Earls of <hi>Glencarne</hi> and <hi>Kenmore,</hi> raiſed another Army of 4000. Horſe and
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:116025:299"/>Foot, but were ſoon diſſipated by the vigilancy of Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Morgan,</hi> who after a ſhort but ſmart fight, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one hundred and fifty of them, and defeated all the reſt. Suſpicions are neceſſary allarms, as they at leaſt ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not to be overtaken with too much ſecurity of their affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another great plot</hi> was now again diſcovered, the chief conſpirators were ſaid to be Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>John Gerrard,</hi> Brothers, <hi>John Jones</hi> an Apothecary, and <hi>Thomas Tender, Somerſet Fox,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Peter Vowel;</hi> who were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but two onely ſuffered, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> who was hanged. Alſo about the ſame time the Portugal Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors Brother was brought to his tryal for the piſtolling of one Mr. <hi>Greenwood</hi> by a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> one of his high ſpirited followers; the tumult being afterwards occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his retinue, he having been firſt very uncivilly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> in his expatiating of the <hi>New Exchange,</hi> as he termed it in his Declaration; for which Mr. <hi>Gerrard</hi> received a prick with his Dagger, and afterwards had the honour to dye the ſame death. The young unfortunate ſtranger ſuffered a very high favour to pleaſe the <hi>New Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> Chevaliers.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Scotch Highlanders impatient of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh yoke, reſolved to try the other bout; to which purpoſe, they aſſembled together in great numbers, having General <hi>Middleton</hi> to their leader, who was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to them out of <hi>Holland:</hi> but all their endeavours vaniſhed into ſmoak, General <hi>Monk</hi> on the twentieth of <hi>July,</hi> 1654. at a place called <hi>Loughberry,</hi> gave them ſuch a charge as utterly defeated them, and made them incapable of ever after thinking of appearing in Arms again.</p>
               <p>Soon after was a Parliament called, who no ſooner were ſet, but fell upon queſtioning the power by which they were convocated; and doubting of its lawfulneſs were ſoon diſſolved by the ſame power which they diſtruſted. The
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:116025:300"/>Protector at the diſſolution of this ſhort Parliament, made a very long ſpeech, wherein amongſt many other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he hath this expreſſion; <hi>This one thing I ſpeak as thus adviſed, and before God, as having been to this day of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and this hath been my conſtant judgement, well known to many that hear me ſpeak, if this one thing had been inſerted, that one thing, that this Government ſhould have been, and placed in my family hereditary, I would have rejected it.</hi> And a little after, <hi>If this be of humane ſtructure, and invention, and it be an old plotting and contrivance to bring things to this iſſue, and that they are not the births of providence, then they will come to nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding his ſpeech was candied over with Scripture phraſes, and great expreſſions of his zeal for the good government of the Land; yet theſe his actings much diſcontented the common people, whereupon enſued ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in <hi>Shropſhire, Montgomery, Nottinghamſhire, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> and <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> but the moſt conſiderable was at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where Sir <hi>Joſeph Wagſtaff, Penruddock,</hi> and <hi>Jones,</hi> who had formerly been Officers in the late Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, having gotten together about 200. armed men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>Salisbury,</hi> ſeized on all the Inns and chief Houſes; and the Aſſizes being holden there at that time, they took away the Judges Commiſſions and Pattents, and all their Horſes, and ſo marched away. Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Malleverer</hi> aſſembled ſome Forces alſo in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> but not being ſeconded according to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they diſperſt themſelves on their own account. For theſe actings were put to death Maſter <hi>Lucas, Thorp, Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, Graves,</hi> and <hi>Penruddock,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> was taken and impriſoned, and afterwards beheaded upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as I ſhall ſhow you in its due place. About this time the great head-piece of <hi>Europe</hi> joyns his Foxes tale to our Lions skin; correſpondencies are held betwixt the French and us, which occaſioning ſome jealouſies with
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:116025:300"/>ſome other bitter pills that had before been ſwallowed, but not digeſted by the Spaniard, cauſed ſome heart-burnings; which ſoon broke forth into an open War, firſt mannaged by the Generals, <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Venables,</hi> who on the 27. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1654. with a gallant Fleet ſet ſail from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and on the 28. of <hi>January</hi> following, arrived at the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> where they ſeized on 18. <hi>Holland</hi> Merchant men, who contrary to the Ordinance of the long Parliament traffiqued in thoſe parts; from thence they ſailed to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving near to the port of <hi>Sancta Domingo,</hi> where by the deepneſs of the ſands, and heat of the climate being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely tired, they were by the Spaniards put to flight, and enforced to march back again to their Ships; from thence they ſet Sail to the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which after a little reſiſtance they maſtered, and have ſince preſerved, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Spaniards to regain the ſame, landed there with two or three thouſand men, but were diſcomfitted with the loſs of all their Cannon and Baggage.</p>
               <p>In the interim General <hi>Blake</hi> with a conſiderable Fleet of Ships, having caſt Anchor before <hi>Tunis, April,</hi> 18. 1655. ſent unto the Dy of the place, demanding ſatisfaction for ſome Engliſh Ships, which the Pyrats of thoſe parts had carryed away, and the liberty of the Engliſh ſlaves they had detained; but his meſſage and himſelf was refuſed with ſcorn and deriſion: the Turks making this anſwer, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our Caſtles of</hi> Galleta, <hi>and our Caſtles and Veſſels of</hi> Porto Ferino, <hi>do your worſt againſt them, and do not think to brave us with the ſight of your great Fleet.</hi> This anſwer ſo exaſperated the Engliſh Admiral, that notwithſtanding there were one hundred and twenty Guns planted on the ſhore, and in the Caſtle againſt them; yet regardleſs of all danger, he ſet upon their Men of War which lay in <hi>Porto Ferino,</hi> and in leſs then four ours ſpace, burnt all their Ships; being in number nine, to their very Keels, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the King of <hi>Tunis</hi> to ſeek to the Engliſh for their
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:116025:301"/>friendſhip, and reſtored all the Priſoners for little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſucceſſes were ſeconded by two other great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries obtained over the Spaniards at ſea; the one by General <hi>Mountague</hi> about nine Leagues from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſix of their ſhips, whereof two were taken, two run aground, one ſunk, and another burnt, and therein the Marqueſs of <hi>Badex,</hi> his Wife and Daughter; the young Marqueſs and his Brother, with a great deal of wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, and brought into <hi>England.</hi> This Fight being incomparably related by the Laureat of our times, I thought fit to inſert it, not to deprive the Reader of ſo Elegant a Poem; let him wave the Poetical flattery of it as he pleaſes.</p>

               <p>About this time the blaſphemies of many Sectaries in <hi>England</hi> were horrible; particularly of one <hi>James Nailor,</hi> who under a ſeeming Sanctity, and pretended illuminations, vented moſt horrible blaſphemies, for which he was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Exceſter</hi> Goal; yet had this wretched Impoſtor ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched his followers to the committing of ſtrange abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they aſcribed to him Divine Honors, and gave him in Scripture phraſe, the ſame titles which are applicable to none but Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>In a Letter of one <hi>Richard Fairman</hi> to him, are theſe horrid expreſſions, <hi>[I am fil'd with joy and rejoycing when I behold thee in the eternal unity.

<pb n="570" facs="tcp:116025:304"/>they ſhall open their ears, and ſhall give unto him of their Gold, Frankincenſe, and Myrrh.]</hi> The ſame woman in another Letter to him proceeds thus, [<hi>O thou faireſt of ten thouſand, thou only begotten Son of God, how my heart panteth after thee; O ſtay me with flaggons, and comfort me with wine; my well-beloved thou art like a Roe, or young Hart, upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Spices.</hi> Then by way of Poſtſcript her Husband <hi>Thomas Stranger</hi> addes this, <hi>Thy name is no more to be called</hi> James, <hi>but</hi> Jeſus. Alſo a Maid named <hi>Dorcas Erbury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined, declared <hi>James Nailor to be the Holy one of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, the only Son of God,</hi> and that ſhe pulled off his ſtockings, &amp; put her cloaths under his feet, becauſe he is the holy Lord of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that ſhe knew no other Saviour but him; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming moreover, that the Spirit of the Lord within her commanded her to call him Lord and Maſter, and to ſerve him. That in <hi>Exceſter</hi> Goal he had raiſed her from the dead after ſhe had been dead two dayes; and that he ſhould ſit at the right hand of the Father, and judge the world.</p>
               <p>Having ſeduced theſe ſilly ſouls into ſuch damnable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and gotten releaſement out of <hi>Exceſter</hi> Goal, he began immediately to play his pranks at divers places in the Weſt; particularly at <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Glaſtenbury</hi> thorow which Towns he rode on Horſeback, a man going bare before him, ſome walking afoot on each ſide of his ſtirrup, and others ſtrewing their garments in the way; from thence he took his journey towards <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and coming to a Village called <hi>Bedminſter,</hi> about a mile from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> rid thorow it in the ſame preſumptuous blaſphemous manner, as he did before at <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Glaſtenbury.</hi> There accompanied him two men, with each a woman behinde on Horſeback, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted when the came to the Suburbs of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it along on each ſide of <hi>Nailors</hi> Horſe, the man ſtill bare-headed leading the Horſe, and all the way they went, they ſung, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> and then
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:116025:304"/>the women led the horſe with the reins in their hands, up to the high Croſs of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and from thence to the White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hart-Inne in <hi>Broad-ſtreet:</hi> by this time the Magiſtrates hearing of their doings, ſent for <hi>Nailor</hi> and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who came ſinging all the way <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> &amp;c. The Magiſtrates of <hi>Briſtol</hi> having examined him, ſent him up to the Parliament (together with the narrative of his actions committed in thoſe parts,) to receive his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which was as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> James Nailor <hi>be ſet with his head in the Pillory, in the new</hi> Palace <hi>at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>during the ſpace of two hours, on Thurſday next, and ſhall be whipped by the hangman through the ſtreets from</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>to the</hi> Old Exchange London; <hi>and there likewiſe be ſet in the Pillory, for the ſpace of two hours, between the hours of eleven and one, on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday next; in each of the ſaid places, wearing a paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an inſcription of his Crimes: and that at the</hi> Old Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <hi>his Tongue ſhall be bored through with a hot iron; and that he be there alſo ſtigmatized in the forehead with the letter</hi> B. <hi>and that he be afterwards ſent to</hi> Briſtol, <hi>and conveyed into, and thorow the ſaid City on a horſe bare-ridg'd, with his face backward; and there alſo publickly whipp'd, the next market-day after he comes thither. That from thence he be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to priſon in</hi> Bridewel, London, <hi>and there reſtrained from the ſociety of all people, and kept to hard labour, till he ſhall be releaſed by Parliament; and during that time be debarred the uſe of pen, ink, and paper, and ſhall have no relief, but what he earns by his daily labour,</hi> which accordingly was executed upon him, <hi>December</hi> 17. 1656.</p>
               <p>His flies and familiars were ſtill uſeful to him for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of more ſtrange deſigns; the revealing of which, no queſtion kept many conſpiracies from being attempted, to which effect there is <hi>yet another plot,</hi> againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors life, intended by <hi>Miles Sindercomb, alias</hi> Fiſh, one who had formerly been a Parliament Souldier, under the
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:116025:305"/>command of Sir <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> together with one <hi>Cecil;</hi> induced thereunto, as is ſaid by <hi>Don Alonſo,</hi> the late Spaniſh Ambaſſador: to the effecting their deſigns, they are ſaid to have hired a houſe at <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> adjoyning by the High-way ſide, to have ſhot him in his Coach, as he paſſed by; but that failing, they intended to have ſhot him in <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> and to that purpoſe that they filed off the Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Gates, for their better eſcape; and this miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, that they intended to have fired <hi>White Hall.</hi> For theſe offences <hi>Sindercomb</hi> was arraigned at the Upper Bench Bar in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall, February,</hi> 9. 1656. where being found guilty by the Jury, he was condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered at <hi>Tyburne;</hi> but before his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was found dead in his bed, and ſeveral <hi>preſumptions of a violent death appearing on him,</hi> it was concluded he poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned himſelf. Afterwards he was drawn from the Tower unto Tower-hill, at a horſe tail, with his head forward, and there under the Scaffold, turned into a hole ſtark na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and a ſtake ſpiked and plated with iron, driven through him into the earth. It is to be obſerved that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the vigilancy of the Guard of the Tower was over this Gentleman, that he dyed with as freſh a colour as Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> is ſaid to have expired with.</p>
               <p>But to return where we left, that ſucceſsful Sea-man Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Blake,</hi> the Protectors indended <hi>Drake,</hi> an honeſt ſtout incomparable Sea-man, he ſailing with his Fleet to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Cruza,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> in which Port lay ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen great Spaniſh Veſſels, laden with rich Merchandizes from the Indies, or ſtored with proviſions and other manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures to be tranſported thither. He on the 20. of <hi>April,</hi> 1657. ſet upon them, and notwithſtanding the Caſtle and ſix or ſeven forts which commanded the place, in leſs then four hours time he deſtroyed them all, to their ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble detriment, not ſixty of his own men being loſt.</p>
               <p>But to return into <hi>England, June</hi> the 20. 1657. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:116025:305"/>with great pomp and magnificence was inſtalled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Parliament then ſitting; to which purpoſe at the upper end of <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> a rich Cloath of State was ſet up, and under it a Chair of State placed upon an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of two degrees, covered with Carpets, and before it a Table with a Chair appointed for the Speaker of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and on each ſide of the Hall upon the ſaid ſtructure were Seats raiſed one above another, and decently covered for the Members of Parliament, and below them, Seats on one ſide for the Judges of the Land, and on the other ſide for the Aldermen of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About two of the Clock in the afternoon, the Protector met the Parliament in the Painted Chamber, and paſſed ſuch Bills as were preſented to him; after which they went in order to the place appointed in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall;</hi> the Protector ſtanding under the Cloath of Eſtate, the Lord <hi>Widdrington</hi> Speaker of the Parliament, addreſt himſelf to him in this Speech.</p>

                        <hi>You are now upon a great Theatre, in a large Chore of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; you have the Parliament of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>before you; on your right hand my Lords the Judges, and on your left hand, the Lord Major, Aldermen, and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs of</hi> London: <hi>the moſt noble and populous City of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>The Parliament, with the interpoſition of your ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, makes Laws, and the Judges, and Governours of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>are the great diſpenſers of thoſe Laws to the people.</hi>

                        <hi>The occaſion of this great convention and intercourſe, is, to give an inveſtiture to your Highneſs in that eminent place of</hi> Lord Protector; <hi>a name you had before, but it is now ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by the full and unanimous conſent of the people of theſe three Nations aſſembled in Parliament: you have no new name, but a new date added to the old name; the</hi> 16. <hi>of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, <hi>is now changed to the</hi> 26. <hi>of</hi> June.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I am commanded by the Parliament, to make oblation to your Highneſs of four things in order to this Inauguration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt is a Robe of Purple, an Embleme of Magiſtracy, and imports righteouſneſs and juſtice; when you have put on the veſtment, I may ſay, (and I hope without offence) that you are a Gown man. This Robe is of a mixt colour, to ſhew the mixture of juſtice and mercy, which are then moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent when they are well tempered together. Juſtice without Mercy, is wormwood and bitterneſs, and Mercy without Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is of a too ſoft a temper for government; for a Magiſtrate muſt have two hands,</hi> Plectentem &amp; Amplectentem.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The next thing is a Bible, a Book that contains the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; in which you have the honor and happineſs to be well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. This is the Book of life, conſiſting of two Teſtaments, the old and new. In the firſt we have</hi> Chriſtum velatum, <hi>Chriſt in Types, Shadows, and Figers; in the latter we have</hi> Chriſtum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velatum, <hi>Chriſt revealed. This Book carries in it the grounds of the true Chriſtian Proteſtant Religion; its a Book of Books, it contains in it both precepts and examples for good government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alexander <hi>ſo highly valued the Books of his Maſter</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle, <hi>and other great Princes other books, that they have laid them every night under their Pillows. Theſe are all but Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends and Romances to this one Book; a Book to be had alwayes in remembrance: I finde it ſaid in a part of this Book which I ſhall deſire to read, and it is this.</hi> Deut. 17. And it ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, that he ſhall write a copy of this Law in a Book, out of that wich is before the Prieſts and the Levites. And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord God, and to keep all the words of his Law and thoſe Statutes, to do them. That his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren; and that he turn not aſide from the Commandment, to the right hand or to the left, to the end he may prolong his dayes in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he and his Children in the midſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The next thing that I am to offer to your Higneſs, is a Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, not unlike a ſtaff, for you are to be a ſtaff to the weak and poor; it's of ancient uſe in this kinde; it's ſaid in Scripture, in reference to</hi> Judah, <hi>the Royal Tribe,</hi> That the Scepter ſhall not depart from <hi>Judah. It was of like uſe in other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and governments:</hi> Homer <hi>the Prince of the Greek Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, calls Kings and Princes Scepter-bearers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The laſt thing is a Sword, not a Military, but a Civil Sword; a Sword rather for defence then offence; not to defend your ſelf onely, but others alſo: the Sword is an Embleme of Juſtice. The noble Lord</hi> Talbot, <hi>in</hi> Henry <hi>the Sixths time, wrote upon his Sword,</hi> Ego ſum <hi>Talboti,</hi> propter occidendum inimicos meos; <hi>This Gallant Lord was a better Souldier then a Critick. If I might preſume to fix a Motto upon this Sword, it ſhould be this,</hi> Ego ſum Domini Protectoris ad protegendum populum meum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I ſay, this Sword is an Embleme of Juſtice, and is to be uſed as King <hi>Solomon</hi> uſed his, for the diſcovery of truth in the points of Juſtice. I may ſay of this Sword as King <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliah's</hi> Sword. <hi>There is none like this,</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is the proper vertue of the Imperial Throne, and by Juſtice the Thrones of Kings and Princes are eſtabliſhed. Juſtice is a Royal vertue, which as one ſaith of it, doth employ the other three Cardinal Vertues in her ſervice. 1. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to diſcern the nocent from the innocent. 2. <hi>Fortitude,</hi> to proſecute, and execute. 3. <hi>Temperance,</hi> ſo to carry Juſtice that paſſion be no ingredient, and that it be without confuſion, or precipitation.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>You have given ample teſtimony in all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ſo that this Sword in your hand will be a right Sword of Juſtice, attended with <hi>Wiſdom, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Temperance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you have all theſe together, what a comely and glorious ſight is it to behold, <hi>A Lord Protector in a purple Robe, with a Scepter in his hand, a Sword of Juſtice girt about

               <p>The Speech being ended, Maſter Speaker came from his Chair, took the Robe, and therewith veſted the Protector, being aſſiſted therein by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Lord <hi>Whitlock</hi> and others. Which done, the Bible was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him; after that the Sword girt about him; and laſt of all he had the Scepter delivered him. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed, Maſter Speaker returned unto his Chair, and admimiſtred him his Oath, <hi>in haec verba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do in the preſence, and by the name of God Almighty, promiſe and ſwear, that to the uttermoſt of my power I will uphold and maintain the true Reformed Proteſtant Chriſtian Religion, in the purity thereof, as it is contained in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament to the uttermoſt of my power and underſtanding: and encourage the Profeſſion and Profeſſours of the ſame; and that to the utmoſt of my power I will endeavour as Chief Magiſtrate of theſe three Nations, the maintenance and preſervation of the Peace and Safety, and juſt Rights and Priviledges of the People thereof: and ſhall in all things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our beſt knowledge and power, govern the people of theſe three Nations according to Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Ceremonies being performed, a Herald of Arms by ſound of Trumpet proclaimed him, <hi>Lord Protectour of England, Scotland, Ireland, and the Dominions thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> hereupon the Trumpets ſounded again, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (after the uſual manner) gave ſeveral acclamations, with loud ſhouts, crying, <hi>God ſave the Lord Protectour.</hi> His Higneſs had ſcarce accepted of theſe Honours, but as if the ill affected would not let him breath, <hi>yet another Plot</hi> is diſcovered, Collonel <hi>Edward Sexby</hi> is ſaid to have conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the Lord Protector; for which he was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:116025:307"/>to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where having continued about half a year, he died.</p>
               <p>But to reflect a little back, <hi>Mazarine</hi> that great Miniſter of State, on which hinge all the grand Affairs of <hi>France</hi> turn, perfects a Peace with <hi>England;</hi> the Protector having no regard to thoſe advantages that <hi>Spain</hi> might render him as to Commerce, the places of Hoſtage which ſhe proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put into his hands, as <hi>Gravelin, Dunkirk,</hi> and others, he was ſwayed with other Intereſt which he beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood himſelf, to prefer an Alliance and League with <hi>France</hi> before all thoſe advantages, except his civillity induce't him (which ſeldom had ſuch power over him) to look more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly upon <hi>France</hi> as the weakeſt at that time, being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by ſome of her Allies, as quite diſordered by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine War in her own Bowels, her Navigation totally ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, as the Pirates of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> had blockt up all her Sea Ports; whereas the Engliſh ſcowred thoſe Seas, chaſt away the Pyrates, and reduced the <hi>Mounſieur</hi> and <hi>Diego</hi> by their ſucceſſes to their ſo likely advantageous peace. Indeed (as one writes) it was a high generoſity, ſince the Engliſh cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the French to loſe <hi>Graveling and Dunkirk,</hi> to help <hi>France</hi> again to take thoſe places. In the mean ſpace was not here rare bandying of Intereſts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> having thus perfected a Peace with <hi>England,</hi> they joyntly reſolve to unite againſt the Spaniard; hereupon Sir <hi>John Reynolds</hi> with ſix thouſand Foot was ſent into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> to joyn with the French Cavalry, which compleated as gallant an Army as had been ſeen in <hi>France</hi> for many years together. Theſe joyntly beſiege and take <hi>Mardike;</hi> a ſtrong Fort of the Spaniards in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereof Major General <hi>Morgan</hi> took poſſeſſion for the Engliſh, as the earneſt of further Conqueſts; which the Spaniards attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting for to regain, were twice repulſed with very great loſs.</p>
               <p>But the joy of theſe Succeſſes was mitigated by the death
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:116025:308"/>of Admiral <hi>Blake,</hi> who as he got his Honour by the Sea, died on it, and that within ſight of <hi>Plimouth.</hi> He was a man who had deſerved of his Countrey, and might juſtly be ſtiled the <hi>Neptune</hi> thereof. His Body was brought with a Naval pomp by water from <hi>Greenwich</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being a ſuitable Ceremony to his employment, and was there buried in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths Chappel. Upon whom an Ingenuous perſon beſtowed this Epitaph.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Here lies a man, made <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> ſhake,</l>
                  <l>Made <hi>France</hi> to tremble, and the Turks to quake:</l>
                  <l>Thus he tame'd men, but if a Lady ſtood</l>

               </q>
               <p>Soon after was St. <hi>Venant</hi> taken by the Engliſh, the Lord <hi>Henry Cromwel</hi> made Deputy of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Sir <hi>John Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> Collonel <hi>VVhite,</hi> and ſome other Officers drowned upon <hi>Goodwin Sands,</hi> as they were coming out of <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>One writes, that the ſubtilty of diſcovering of Plots, though but in the <hi>Embrio,</hi> or before they are hatcht, in the time of peace, is the moſt ſuccinct way of letting of blood. March 24. (the laſt day of the year accounted for) 1657. a great Conſpiracy was again diſcovered in <hi>London,</hi> ſeveral Regiments' (as was ſaid) being enrolled; who on the firſt day of <hi>May</hi> in the night time ſhould have ſet fire on ſeveral parts of the City, and whileſt the confuſion and horrour thereof had ſeized all men, they ſhould have made a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maſacre of all who oppoſed them. Hereupon ſeveral
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:116025:308"/>perſons were apprehended, as Doctor <hi>Hewet,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> Collonel <hi>Aſbton,</hi> &amp;c. and a High Court of Juſtice erected for the tryal of them; and firſt they began with Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> the Articles charged againſt them will in part diſcover themſelves in their ſeveral ſpeeches made juſt before their deaths. In ſhort, they were both condemned, Dr. <hi>Hewet</hi> (profeſſing himſelf to be ignorant of ſuch Law, though amongſt the moſt learned Divines few of them were more knowing in the Goſpel) being taken in three defaults upon formalities of the Court, was proceeded againſt as mute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 8. 1658. was the day appointed for their behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> firſt mounting the ſtage, ſpake in effect as followeth.</p>

               <floatingText xml:lang="eng" type="speech">
                  <body>
                     <p>I am now become a publick ſpectacle to men and Angels, and (I hope) God who is omniſcient, is now beholding me with much pitty, and great mercy and compaſſion; and the more, becauſe I am now come to that end that his own Son came into the world to, to bear witneſs to the Truth; he himſelf ſaid, <hi>For this end was I born, for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs to the Truth.</hi> I was brought into the world (the Chriſtian world) for to bear witneſs to the truth of the Goſpel, as a common Chriſtian; I was brought into the world (the Church) as a Miniſter of his bleſſed Word and Sacraments; [Bleſſed be his name for that great honor and dignity;] and I came into the world to dye more immediately for the teſtimony of Jeſus, which God hath now called me to. I came into this world (this Commonwealth) to be a member thereof, to bear witneſs to the truths of the Cuſtoms, the Laws, the Liberties, and Priviledges thereof; ſo I am a Member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And methinks it ſeems to me a ſtrange thing, that in as much as we all plead for Liberty and Priviledges, and I pleading for the Priviledges, the Laws, the Statutes, and the Cuſtoms of this Land, yet I ſhould dye by thoſe that ſhould ſtand for the Laws, the Statutes, and Priviledges of the Land. And I am here beheld by thoſe that plead for their Liberties, and I hope I am pittied, becauſe I here give up my ſelf willingly and freely to be a State-Martyr for the publick good; and I had rather dye many deaths my
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:116025:309"/>ſelf, then betray my fellow-freemen to ſo many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that they might be like to ſuffer, by being ſubject to the wills of them that willed me to this death.</p>
                     <p>And it is worthy remembrance that Maſter <hi>Solicitor</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving impeached me of Treaſon to the Commiſſioners of the Court againſt his Highneſs, I did often (when brought before thoſe Commiſſioners) plead for the liberties of the people of <hi>England,</hi> though I had no knowledge of the Law, yet I had inſtructions from thoſe that were learned in the Law, and had ſeveral Law-caſes and Preſidents put into my hand, though not by them, and urged ſeveral Law-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and made my appeal. Firſt, for the Judicature that I was to be tryed by, Whether it were according to Law? Whether it were according to the Act? and whether it were according to the words of the ſaid Act? I did appeal to have the ſaid Act argued by learned Lawyers on both ſides, and then to be reſolved by his Highneſs own Councel, which was denied me. [This by the by.] I preſſing the Argument, made a ſecond Appeal, that thoſe Judges, if they would give ſingly their ſeveral judgements that it was a juſt and lawful Court of Judicature, I would anſwer to my Charge. I did make another Appeal to thoſe that were his Highneſſes Councel, and pleaded againſt me. That if they would deliver it to me under their hands to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, I would then go on to plead, and anſwer to the Charge. What was then ſaid further my ſpirits being faint, I ſhall not ſay much, but onely this, I was taken in three defaults upon formality of the Court. It ſeems it is a cuſtom in all Courts, (which I did not know before) that if they anſwer not the third time ſpeaking by the Clerk, that then they are guilty of three defaults, and proceeded againſt as mute: [I had no ſuch knowledge of the Law.] So they found me guilty of thoſe defaults; and when I would have pleaded, and reſolved to begin to plead, I was taken from the Bar. I did the next day make my Petition
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:116025:310"/>to the Court in the Painted Chamber, two Petitions were preſented, the ſame in effect; the former, the Title was miſtaken. Yet becauſe the title was miſtaken, and no anſwer given, therefore it was that another Petition was drawn up to the ſame effect, with a new title given, (as I remember) preſented by the Serjeant at Arms; and one writ it over in ſuch haſte, leſt they ſhould be drawn out of the Painted Chamber into the Court, that I had not time to read it over, onely I ſubſcribed my name, and there was in the front of the Petition a word left out, but what the word was, I know not; and this was taken ſo ill, as if I had put an affront and contempt on the Court: And it was thought they would have heard me plead; and then becauſe of that miſtake, they ſent word, I ſhould have my anſwer when I came into the Court, and my anſwer was the ſentence of condemnation. And therefore I pray with all my ſoul, that God would forgive all thoſe that occaſioned the charge to be drawn againſt me, to give ſuch unjuſt things againſt me: I pray with all my ſoul, that God would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all thoſe that upon ſo ſlender and ſmall grounds ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd me to dye, taking advantage of ſuch ſimple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as I was in. And I had at the very beginning of my pleading, engaged their Honours no advantage ſhould be taken againſt me to my prejudice, that in as much as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood nothing of the Law: And having heard that a man in the nicety of the Law might be loſt in the ſeverity thereof, meerly for ſpeaking a word out of ſimple igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I made it my prayer to them that no advantage might be taken againſt me to the prejudice of my perſon: And there was to me a ſeeming conſent; for the Preſident told, there ſhould be no advantage taken againſt me; and upon theſe Conſiderations I am afraid there was too great uncharitableneſs: but I pray God forgive them from the very bottom of my ſoul, and I deſire that even thoſe that ſhed my blood, may have the bowels of the God of mercy ſhed for them.</p>

                     <p>And now having given you the occaſion of my coming hither, it is fit I ſhould give you ſomewhat as concerning my ſelf as I am a Chriſtian, and as I am a Cleargy-man: Firſt, as I am a Chriſtian, I thank God I was baptized to the Holy Church, ſo I was baptized to be a Member of the Holy Catholique Church, that is, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which I dare ſay for purity of Doctrine, and orderly Diſcipline, till a ſad Reformation had ſpoiled the face of the Church, and made it a query whether it were a Church, or no; I ſay, it was more purely Divine and Apoſtolical, then any other Doctrine or Church in the Chriſtian World, whether National, or Claſſical, or Congregational. And I muſt tell you, That as I am a Member of this Church, ſo I am a Member of the holy Catholique Church, and ſhall give a moſt juſt confeſſion of my Faith both negatively, and affirmatively: negatively, I am ſo a Member of the holy Catholique Church, that I abhor all Sects, Schiſms, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Tyranny in Religion. Affirmatively ſo, that as I hold communion with, ſo I love and honour all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the world that love the ſame Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, and call on his name agreeing with thoſe truths that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, and clearly demonſtrated in the Word of God, both in the Old and New Teſtaments; though in Charity diſſenting from ſome others that are not neceſſary. And I, as I am thus a Chriſtian, I hope for ſalvation through the merits of Chriſt Jeſus; his blood I rely on, his merits I truſt to for the ſalvation of my own ſoul. Though to this Faith, good works are neceſſary, not meritorious in us, but onely made meritorious by Chriſt his death; by his all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, by his ſatisfaction, and his righteouſs, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come meritorious, but in us they are no other then as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed rags. And truly as I am a Member of the Church, ſo I told you I was a Member of this Community, and ſo pleaded for the Liberties and Priviledges thereof. I muſt now anſwer ſomething I am aſperſed withal in the world.</p>
                     <pb n="584" facs="tcp:116025:311"/>
                     <p>They talk of ſomething of a Plot, and a Treaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and that I had a great intereſt in the knowledge and practice thereof, and that for the ſaving my life, I would have diſcovered and betrayed I cannot tell what: I hope my converſation hath not been ſuch here in this City, where I have been a long time very well known, as to make one imagine I ſhould intermeddle in ſuch an action, and go ſo contrary to the practice of my profeſſion; and I hope there are none ſo uncharitable towards me, as to believe I had a knowledge of that deſign.</p>
                     <p>Here I muſt come to particulars for a Plot, of having a deſign upon the City of <hi>London</hi> for the firing of it: I ſo much tremble at the thought of the thing that ſhould have been done, as they ſay, for the carrying on of ſuch a deſign, (if my heart deceive me not) had I known it, I ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the thing, I ſhould have been the firſt diſcoverer of it: nor ever had I correſpondency or meetings with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as would have carried on ſuch a deſign. It is ſaid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I entertained the Earl, the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond;</hi> to my remembrance I never ſaw the face of that honourable perſon in my life. It is ſaid, One Lords day I did preach at Saint <hi>Gregory's</hi> and the next Lords day I was at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> or <hi>Bruges,</hi> and kiſt the Kings hand, and brought I cannot tell what orders and inſtructions from him: this I ſhall ſay, For theſe three years laſt paſt together, I have not been ſixty miles from this City of <hi>London,</hi> and I think it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further to either of thoſe places then threeſcore miles. It is ſaid that I kept correſpondence with one <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Biſhop:</hi> they are perſons I have heard of their names, but never ſaw their faces, and to my knowledge I do not know they know me; nor do I know them at all, but onely as I have heard of their names. And whoſoever elſe hath ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted ſuch things againſt me, I know not.</p>
                     <p>His Highneſs was pleaſed to tell me, I was like a flaming Torch in the midſt of a ſheaf of Corn: he meaning, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:116025:311"/>a publick Preacher, was able to ſet the City on fire by ſedition and combuſtions, and promoting deſigns. Here tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I do ſay, and have it from many of thoſe that are Judges of the High Court, that upon examination of the buſineſs they have not found me a meddler at all in theſe Affairs. And truly, I muſt needs ſay therefore, that it was a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable act in them (who ever they were) that brought ſuch accuſations againſt me, and irritated his Highneſs againſt me. I will not ſay it was malice, it might be zeal, but it was raſh zeal which cauſed me to be ſentenced to this place: the God of mercy pardon and forgive them all, and truly as I am a Member of the Church, and as a Member of the Community whereon behalf I have been ſpeaking, I cannot but do as our Saviour himſelf did for his Diſciples when he was to be taken from them, he bleſſed them, and aſcended up to heaven. My truſt is in the mercy of the moſt High, I ſhall not miſcarry; and however my dayes are ſhortned by this unexpected doom, and ſhall be brought untimely to the grave: I cannot go without my prayers for a bleſſing upon all the people of this Land, and cannot but bleſs them all in the Name of God, and beſeech God to bleſs them in all their wayes, and his bleſſing be upon them.</p>

                        <p>Let us pray.</p>
                        <p>O moſt glorious Lord God, thou whoſe dwelling is ſo far above the higheſt Heavens, that thou humbleſt thy ſelf but to look upon the things that are in heaven, and that are in earth, and thou doeſt whatſoever thou wilt both in heaven, in earth, in the ſea, and in all deep places; in thy hands are the hearts of all men, and thou turneſt them which way ſoever thou wilt, O Lord look in mercy and compaſſion we beſeech thee, on this great and innumerous people of this Land; look upon them O Lord, with an eye of pitty, not with an eye of fury and indignation; O look not upon all thoſe great and grievous ſins that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:116025:312"/>thee moſt juſtly to wrath and diſpleaſure againſt us. Gracious God, who can ſtand in thy ſight when thou art angry? when thou with rebuke doeſt correct man for ſin, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like as it were a Moth fretting a Garment. O Lord, thy indignation and wrath lyes heavy upon us, and thou haſt vexed us with thy ſcourges, thou haſt made us a reproach and a by-word amongſt our Neighbours, and the very heathen laugh us to ſcorn. O that thou wouldeſt turn us again, O Lord God of Hoſts; that thou wouldeſt ſhew us the light of thy countenance, that we may behold it; that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt humble us for all thoſe ſins and grievous tranſgreſſions that are amongſt us; for thoſe Atheiſms, for thoſe infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, horrid blaſphemies, and prophaneneſs; for thoſe ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, for thoſe Hereſies, for thoſe Schiſms, Errors, and all thoſe blindneſſes of heart, pride, vain glory, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; for that envy, hatred, and malice, and all unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, that hath ſet us one againſt another, that we are ſo daſhed one againſt another, even to deſtroy each other; <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and both againſt <hi>Judah.</hi> O Lord we are like thoſe Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites and Ammonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — This thou haſt done to us O Lord, becauſe we have rebelled againſt thee: O how greatly and grievouſly have we ſinned againſt thee, yet for all this, thou haſt not requited us according to our ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings, for thou mighteſt have brought us to deſolation and deſtruction: fire might have come down from heaven, and deſtroyed us; our forreign enemies, and the enemies of thee, and thy Chriſt our Saviour, might have ſwallowed us up. What have we not deſerved! yet O the long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and patience, and goodneſs of our God! O Lord our God, we pray thee that thy patience and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might lead to repentance that thou wouldeſt be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thou who delighteſt not in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn from his ſins and live, that thou
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:116025:312"/>wouldeſt turn us unto thee O Lord, and we ſhall be turned: draw us, and we ſhall run after thee: draw us with the cords of Love, and by the bands of loving kindneſs, by the powerful working of thy holy ſpirit in our ſouls, working contrition in our hearts, and a godly ſorrow for all our ſins, even a ſorrow to repentance, and a repentance to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation never to be repented of. Lord break thoſe ſtony hearts of ours by the hammer of thy word, mollifie them by the oyl of thy grace, ſmite theſe rocky hearts of ours by the rod of thy moſt gracious power, that we may ſhed forth rivers of tears for all the ſins we have committed. O that thou wouldeſt make us grieve becauſe we cannot grieve, and to weep becauſe we cannot weep enough; that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt humble us more and more in the true ſight and ſenſe of all our provocation againſt thee; and that thou wouldeſt be pleaſed in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt to cleanſe us from all our ſins; Lord let his blood that ſpeaks better things then that of <hi>Abel,</hi> cry louder in thine ears for mercy, then all thoſe miſchiefs and wickedneſſes that have been done amongſt us for vengeance. O beſprinkle our polluted, but penitent ſouls, in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that we may be clean in thy ſight, and that the light of thy countenance may ſhine upon us. Lord be pleaſed to ſeal unto our ſouls the free pardon and forgiveneſs of all our ſins: ſay to each of our ſouls, and ſay that we may hear it, that thou art well pleaſed with us, and appeaſed towards us. Lord, do thou by the Spirit aſſure our ſpirits, that we are thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that thou art reconciled to us in the blood of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> To this end, O Lord, create in us new hearts, and renew right ſpirits within us. Caſt us not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy ſpirit from us; but give us the comfort of thy help, and eſtabliſh us with thy free ſpirit. Help us to live as they redeemed ones; and (Lord) let us not any longer by our wicked lives deny that moſt holy faith whereof our lips have for ſo long time made

Help us to caſt away all our tranſgreſſions, whereby we have tranſgreſſed, and make us new hearts. Carry us along through the pilgrimage of this world, ſupplying us with all things needful for us; thy grace alone is ſufficient for us: Lord, let thy grace be aſſiſtant to us, to ſtrengthen us againſt all the temptations of Satan, eſpecially againſt thoſe ſins whereunto we are moſt prone, either by cuſtom or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or moſt eaſily provoked. O Lord, with what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſoever thou ſhalt puniſh us, do not puniſh us with ſpiritual judgements and deſertions. Give us not over to our own hearts luſts, to our vile, lewd, and corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: give us not over to hardneſs and impenitency of heart, but make us ſenſible of the leaſt ſin, and give us thy grace to think no ſin little committed againſt thee our God, but that we may be humbled for it, and repent of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it in our lives and converſations: and Lord keep us from preſumptuous ſins, O let not them get the dominion over us, but keep us innocent from the great offence, O Lord our ſtrength and our Redeemer. And Lord ſanctifie unto us all thy methods and proceedings with us, fitting us for all further tribulations and tryals whatſoever thou in thy divine pleaſure ſhalt be pleaſed to impoſe upon us: Lord give us patience, conſtancy, reſolution and fortitude to undergo them, that though we walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, we may fear none ill; knowing that thou O Lord, art mercifully with us, and that with thy rod as well as with thy ſtaff thou wilt ſupport and comfort us; and that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate us from thy love which is in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                        <p>And (gracious God) we beſeech thee be thou pleaſed to look mercifully and compaſſionately on thy holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, and grant that all they that do confeſs thy holy Name, may agree together in the truth of thy holy

Thou haſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed O Lord, the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt thy Church; perform we beſeech thee, thy moſt gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes both to thy whole Church, and to that part of it which thou haſt planted, and now afflicted in theſe ſinful Lands and Nations wherein we live: ariſe, O Lord, and have mercy upon our <hi>Sion,</hi> for it is time that thou have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon her, yea, the time is come, for thy ſervants think upon her ſtones, and it pittieth them to ſee her in the duſt.

                        <p>And we beſeech thee of thy goodneſs and mercy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſuccour all thoſe that in this tranſitory life be in trouble, ſorrow, need, ſickneſs or any other adverſity; Lord help the helpleſs, and comfort the comfortleſs, viſit the ſick, relieve the oppreſſed, help them to right that ſuffer wrong, ſet them at liberty that are in priſon, reſtore the baniſhed, and of thy great mercy, and in thy good time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver all thy people out of their neceſſities: Lord do thou of thy great mercy fit us all for our latter end, for the hour of death and the day of judgement; and do thou in the hour of death and at the day of judgement, from thy wrath and everlaſting damnation, good Lord deliver us, through the croſs and paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="592" facs="tcp:116025:315"/>for raiſing War againſt <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and confering with <hi>J. Stapely,</hi> Eſq; <hi>Henry Mallory,</hi> and others, how to effect the ſame: and delivering Commiſſions to ſeveral perſons in the name of, and as from the ſaid <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> &amp;c. He ſtood long upon it (as did the Doctor before) to have Councel aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and that he might be tryed by a Jury; but finding it would not be granted, he at laſt pleaded not guilty, many witneſſes depoſited againſt him; yet he by his ingenuity ſo cleared himſelf; that notwithſtanding many endeavours to the contrary, he was diſcharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the 17. following, Collonel <hi>Aſhton</hi> and <hi>John Betley</hi> were executed, the one in <hi>Tower-ſtreet,</hi> the other in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide:</hi> Collonel <hi>Aſhton</hi> was the firſt, being drawn on a Sled, that Worthy Divine Doctor <hi>Warmeſtry</hi> ſubmitting for the good of a poor Chriſtians ſoul to lye along with him upon the Sled, that he might loſe no time for his ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. They were drawn from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Towerſtreet</hi> over againſt <hi>Mark-lane</hi> end, where a Gibbet was erected. As he aſcended the Ladder, Doctor <hi>Warmeſtry</hi> ſaid, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who is a ſtrong Tower, be with thee, and make thee know and feel, that there is no other name under heaven, whereby to attain everlaſting life, but by the name of Jeſus. The Bleſſing of God the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt be with you henceforth and for ever, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He being upon the Ladder, expreſt a great deal of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had in the merits and mercies of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt; not doubting but that through the red Sea of his blood he ſhould arrive at the heavenly Canaan, and in little ſpace behold his Saviour, whom his ſoul ſo much longed after. Then fixing his eyes upon the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he ſpake to this effect.</p>
               <q>I am brought here to a ſhameful death; I am an Engliſh man borne, and (as many know) a Gentleman born; I was drawn into this buſineſs by ſeveral perſons, and am
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:116025:315"/>now brought here for my former ſins: God hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me ſeveral times from ſeveral judgements, he hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited me at this time; becauſe I ſlighted, and did not purſue that repentance that I promiſed. Therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all good people to leave off their ſins for Chriſt his ſake, and become new men, for it is that that brings all men to ruine: I beſeech God of mercy have mercy upon my ſoul, Lord God I come to thee, Lord the Father of heaven have mercy upon me, O God the Son Redeemer of the world have mercy upon me, O God the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from the Father and the Son have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me. Remember not my offences, but ſpare me, good Lord God; I beſeech thee ſpare thy ſervant whom thou haſt redeemed, for thy dear Sons ſake. I have no more to ſay, but deſire the prayers of all good people.</q>
               <p>Having ended his Speech he committed his ſpirit into the hands of God, and having ſaid, <hi>Lord have mercy upon my ſoul,</hi> he was turned off the Ladder, and inſtantly cut down, his belly ripped up, and his bowels burnt in a fire ready prepared for that purpoſe; he being not yet dead: then was his head cut off, and his body divided into four quarters, put into a basket and conveyed back to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next they proceeded and fetcht <hi>John Betley</hi> (for there was a great deal of buſineſs done by the Executioner that day) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> where formerly the Croſs ſtood; where was likewiſe a Gibbet ſet up: being come to the place with a Miniſter, the Miniſter read, and the people ſung with him a Pſalm, beginning thus, <hi>O Lord, conſider my diſtreſs,</hi> &amp;c. Then he went up the Ladder, and ſaid as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Lord receive my ſoul, and be merciful to me, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſoul into Almighty Gods hands: for he is my Protector and Redeemer. I am not aſhamed to live, nor afraid to dye; for my converſation hath been ſuch, in Chriſt Jeſus I hope I ſhall finde mercy. As concerning them that are my enemies, I pray God forgive them their

As for the late Plot, I was never but once in company with them concerned therein: I did know of ſuch a thing, but deny that I acted therein. Shall I damn my ſoul at this inſtant? I will ſpeak the truth. One <hi>Brandon,</hi> that was one of them, drew me into the buſineſs, and his man. I carrying work to him, could not refrain his houſe, he ſo often enticed me thereto, and would not let me alone, till he had got me into a houſe, where we drank toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I have no more to ſay as to the Plot, but deſire mercy from God.</q> Having this ſaid, the Executioner turned him off, and the reſt of the Sentence was executed upon him, as before upon Collonel <hi>Aſhton,</hi> and his Head and Quarters were conveyed alſo to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some two dayes after, one <hi>Edmund Stacy</hi> alſo about the ſame Conſpiracy was executed in <hi>Cornhil</hi> over againſt the <hi>Exchange;</hi> as alſo a Youth in <hi>Smithfield</hi> having the rope about his neck, the horror of death being worſe then death it ſelf, but for his ſouls health, was reprieved, the torrent of Blood being for a while ſtayed.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe Tragedies were acting on the Land, a ſtrange accident no leſs prodigeous happened on the water; a Whale of a monſtrous bigneſs, at leaſt ſixty foot, and of a proportionable breadth, was caſt up on the River of <hi>Thames</hi> near <hi>London;</hi> which by the common people was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Prognoſtication of the Protectors death, which enſued not long after.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Flanders,</hi> where we formerly left, the Sea whereof like a ſharp humour did alwayes nouriſh the wounds of incurable evils; nor was the French their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her blood ſufficient, ſhe wanted an Engliſh Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to treat her. Our Armies, whoſe valours made not a ſtand at <hi>Mardike,</hi> but with a gallant Reſolution beſieged <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which being a place of great importance, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard intended to relieve; and with an Army of ſixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:116025:317"/>came within an Engliſh mile and a half of the French Quarters; whereupon the Engliſh and French uniting their Forces, leaving ſome part of them before <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to make good the approaches, and guard the trenches; with fifteen thouſand men, and ten Peeces of Cannon, ſet upon the Spaniard, whom after a long and ſharp Fight, they put to a total rout and confuſion, with the loſs of three thouſand five hundred men; which Victocy was in a manner wholly attributed to the valor of the Engliſh. The loſs of this day loſt the Spaniard <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> who quickly after ſurrendered up the Town upon theſe following Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Town ſhall be yielded up, with all their great Guns, their ſtores of Victuals, Magazines of Arms, and Ammunition, without any embezlement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That all Officers and Souldiers ſhall have liberty to march out with their Arms, Drums beating, Colours fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, two Peeces of Ordnance, and their Baggage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That they ſhall have the liberty to march with a Convoy to conduct them to Saint</hi> Omers.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Articles ſigned, the Spaniards marched out, being about one thouſand Horſe and Foot, and ſeven hundred more that were wounded; the French (according as it was arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled before) put the Engliſh in poſſeſſion thereof, which ever ſince they have maintained.</p>
               <p>I have heard of an expreſſion of the Governours of <hi>Oſtend.</hi> A little before the Maſſacre there, a perſon of quality being ſent thither about the exchange of Priſoners, after he was civilly treated, the glaſſes of wine going freely about; the Governour being in a ſafe place began to throw forth words to this effect; <hi>Sir, is this the mode of your

               </p>
               <p>Soon after the taking of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> deceaſed the Lady <hi>Cleypoll,</hi> ſecond Daughter to the Protector; a Lady whom poſterity will mention with an honourable Character, who often interpoſed, and became an humble Supplicant to her Father for many perſons deſigned to dye; her laſt requeſts as it was thought, for ſome eminent perſons being denied, was a means of haſtening her death, which much ſadned her fathers ſpirits; nor did he long ſurvive her, her death cauſing more wounds in his heart, then all he received in the Wars.</p>
               <p>But as his ſeverity was great towards his enemies, ſo did he excell in gratitude unto his friends; amongſt other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, I ſhall inſtance in the perſon of one <hi>Duret</hi> a Frenchman, who attended him during his Generalſhip, and ſerved him with ſo much fidelity and zeal, as that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him with the mannaging and conduct of the greateſt part of his Domeſtick Affairs, alwayes retaining him nigh his perſon, bearing ſo great an affection towards him, and repoſing ſo entire a confidence in him, that during a great ſicknes which he had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (&amp; whereof it was thought he would have died) he would not be ſerved by any one, nor receive any nouriſhment, or any thing elſe that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto him, ſave from the hands of <hi>Duret,</hi> who both day and night continued to watch by his Maſter; tending him with a ſpecial care and aſſiduity, not giving himſelf a moments reſt until his maſter had recovered his perfect health: which long and continual watches of <hi>Duret,</hi> and the great pains he had taken, drove him into a ſad fit of ſickneſs; to recover him, his endeared Maſter in retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his great ſervices, ſpared no coſt, but applied all the poſſible means that could be procured, not onely by his commands, but by his perſonal viſits (ſo oft as his urgent Affairs would permit him.) <hi>Duret</hi> dying, he ſends over
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:116025:318"/>into <hi>France</hi> for his Mother, Siſter, and two Nephews, to requite in them the obligations he owed to his deceaſed Friend and Servant; and whereas by reaſon of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Stotch Wars, he was as it were confined to the North, he wrote unto his wife, <hi>That ſhe ſhould propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that kindneſs which during his abſence ſhe ſhould ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, unto the Love which ſhe bare unto him.</hi> Inſomuch, that <hi>Durets</hi> mother was admitted into her own Family, and ſeated at her own Table; his Siſter was placed in the rank and quality of a Maid of Honour, and his two Nephews were admitted to be her highneſſes Pages, which love of his he extended towards them to the day of his death.</p>
               <p>One writes, that when he came to have more abſolute power towards the latter end of his dayes, that he hath been heard often to wiſh, that thoſe that had been put to death were yet alive; proteſting ſolemnly, that if he could not have changed their hearts, he would have changed their Dooms, and converted their deaths into Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Waving this digreſſion, as in reſpect of the diſtance of time, we are now come to his own approaching Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe. His death was uſhered in by an extraordinary Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and violent guſt of Weather, which blew down ſome houſes tore the trees up at the roots, one in the old <hi>Palace Yard</hi> by the Parliament Houſe, which by the event hath ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified no otherwiſe then the root and branch of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It was a horrid Tempeſt, as if Nature would have the Protectours death to be accompanied with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral horrour. The ſame is elegantly ſet forth in a Poem by the ſame Laureat. I ſhall ſet down his ſmooth Poem, which was anſwered as roughly in reſpect of the ſingle rapier'd ſenſe, though otherwiſe in the ſame <hi>Virgil</hi> ſtile, line for line; the latter as too Satyrical I have omitted, the other follows.</p>

<pb n="602" facs="tcp:116025:321"/>ſtanding upon an aſcent under a rich Cloath of State; veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Royal Robes, having a Scepter in one hand, and a Globe in the other, a Crown on his head, his Armour lying by him at a diſtance, and the Banners, Banrolls, and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards being placed round about him, together with the other Enſigns of Honour, the whole Room being adorned in a Majeſticall manner, and his ſervants ſtanding by bare-headed, as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 23. was the day appointed for the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of the Funerals, multitudes were the Spectators, which from all places came to behold it, ſo much are we ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with Novelty, that we think no coſt too much for the beholding a two or three hours vanity. The Effigies being a while placed in the middle of a Room, was carried on the Hearſe by ten Gentlemen into the Court-yard, where a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich Canopy of State was borne over it by ſix other Gentlemen, till it was brought and placed in a Chariot; at each end whereof was a ſeat wherein ſat two of his late Highneſs Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber: the Pall which was made of Velvet, and the White Linnen was very large, extending on each ſide of the Carriage and was borne up by ſeveral perſons of honour. The Charriot wherein the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies was conveyed, was covered with black Velvet, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Plumes and Scutcheons, and was drawn by ſix Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes covered with black Velvet, and each of them adorned with Plumes of black Feathers.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the ſtreets were railed in, and ſtrewed with ſand; the Souldiers being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on each ſide of the ſtreets without the Rails, and their Enſigns wrapped up in a Cypreſs mourning Veil.</p>
               <p>The manner of the proceeding to the interrment was briefly thus. Firſt, a Knight Martial advanced on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back with his black Truncheon tipt at both ends with Gold, attended by his Deputy and thirteen men on Horſeback to clear the way.</p>
               <pb n="603" facs="tcp:116025:321"/>
               <p>After him followed the poor men of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in mourning Gowns and Hoods, marching two and two.</p>
               <p>Next unto them followed the ſervants of the ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all qualities, which attended the Funeral.</p>
               <p>Theſe were followed by all his own ſervants, as well infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour as ſuperiour, both within and without the Houſhold, as alfo all his Bargemen at Watermen.</p>
               <p>Next unto theſe followed the Servants and Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Lord Major, and Sheriffs of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then came ſeveral Gentlemen and Attendants on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Ambaſſadours, and the other publick Miniſters.</p>
               <p>After theſe came the poor Knights of <hi>Windſor</hi> in Gowns and Hoods.</p>
               <p>Then followed the Clerks, Secretaries, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers belonging to the Army, the Admiralty, the Treaſury, the Navy, and Exchequer.</p>
               <p>After theſe came the Officers in Command in the Fleet, as alſo the Officers of the Army.</p>
               <p>Next followed the Comiſſioners for Exciſe, thoſe of the Army, and the Committee of the Navy.</p>
               <p>Then follwed the Commiſſioners for the approbation of Preachers.</p>
               <p>Then came the Officers, Meſſengers, and Clerks belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Privy Councel, and the Clerks of both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Next followed his late Highneſs Phyſicians.</p>
               <p>The Head Officers of the Army.</p>
               <p>The chief Officers and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Maſters of the Chancery, with his Highneſs learned Councel at Law.</p>
               <p>The Judges of the Admiralty, the Maſters of Requeſt, with the Judges in <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Barrons of the Exchequer, the Judges of both Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Lord Major of <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>Next to theſe the perſons allied in Bloud to the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and the Members of the Lords Houſe.</p>
               <p>After them the publick Miniſters of Forreign States and Princes.</p>
               <p>Then the Holland Ambaſſadour alone, whoſe Train was born up by four Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Next to him the Portugal Ambaſſadour alone, whoſe Train was held up by four Knights of the Order of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And thirdly the French Ambaſſadour, whoſe Train was alſo held up by four perſons of quality.</p>
               <p>Then followed the Lords Commiſſioners of the great Seal.</p>
               <p>The Lords Commiſſioners of the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>The Lords of the late Protectors Privy Councel.</p>
               <p>After whom followed the Chief Mourner, and thoſe perſons of quality which were his Aſſiſtants, and bare up his Train. All the Nobles were in cloſe mourning, the reſt were but in ordinary, being diſpoſed in their paſſage into ſeveral diviſions, being diſtinguiſhed by Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and by a Standard or Banner born by a perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and his Aſſiſtant, and a Horſe of State covered with black Velvet, and led by a perſon of Honour, followed by two Grooms: Of which Horſes there were eleven in all, four covered with black Cloth, and ſeven with Velvet. Theſe being all paſſed in order, at length the Chariot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the Effigies, on each ſide of which were born ſix Banner Rolls, twelve in all, by as many perſons of honor. The ſeveral pieces of his Armour were born by eight Officers of the Army, attended by a Herald and a Gentleman on each ſide. Next followed <hi>Gartar</hi> principal King of Arms, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Gentleman on each ſide bare-headed.</p>
               <p>Then came the chief Mourner, together with thoſe Lords and other Perſonages that were Supporters and Aſſiſtants to the chief Mourner.</p>
               <p>Then followed the Horſe of Honour in very rich Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:116025:322"/>embroidered upon Crimſon Velvet, and adorned with white, red, and yellow Plumes, and was led by the Maſter of the Horſe.</p>
               <p>Finally, in the cloſe of all followed thoſe of his late Guard, and the Warders of the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Weſt Gate of the Abbey Church in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Hearſe with the Effigies thereon was taken off again from the Chariot by thoſe ten Gentlemen who placed it thereon before, and in their paſſing on to carry it into the Church, the Canopy of State was by the former ſix Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen born over it again: In which ſtately manner it was carried up to the Eaſt end of the Abbey, and there placed in a magnificent Structure purpoſely erected there to receive it; being interred amongſt the Kings and Queens at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> for all which vaſte expences, his Son <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> might have taken up that ſad expreſſion in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil;</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Infandum Regina jubes renovare dolorem,</q>
               <p>had not the Parliament ſince dealt ſo generouſly with him, as to order the payment of his debts contracted by his Fathers Funeral. Certainly the Gentleman expreſſed noble &amp; truly dutiful reſpects to his memory, fit for brave minds to imitate. Thus as great <hi>Oliver</hi> lived victoriouſly, ſo he was buried honourably, <hi>Sic exit.</hi> It was a report that his Effigies was taken down and preſerved from a threatning multitude of the raſcally people; even he that had ſwayed and governed theſe three Nations five years, his Reign being troubleſome, was neceſſitated after his death to be protected in his Picture; his Poſterity after him being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly levelled.</p>
               <p>Thus after many a weary ſtep, having traverſed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Crowns, I muſt now ſet my Reader down at a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. I ſhall end all with a glimpſe rather then a Character, ſome gleaned obſervations on this great Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:116025:323"/>of Fortune, I hope in terms agreeing to truth, ſuch as are neither below nor above his eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his perſon he ſomewhat exceeded the uſual middle ſtature, proportionable without any unevenneſs either of lineaments or parts, accordingly being of a becoming fatneſs, well ſhaped, his aſpect having ſomewhat of the Soldiers, inclining to redneſs, his uſual poſture in his walking was his hand upon his ſword; he had a ſparkling fierce eye, nevertheleſs his uſual deportments were both courteous and harſh at once in his encounters, where he found the leaſt oppoſition. He was hardy and reſolute in his reprehenſions, ſubtil, temperate, and meek in his Councels; he was of a ſtrong conſtitution, and of an active body, an enemy both to eaſe and exceſs; being ever ſuſpitious, circumſpect, and over vigilant, of a notable head-piece; yet if he had any ſpare time, he diſdained not to confer though in matters of leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he delighted to read men more then books, his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence being Maſculine and Martial, rather a natural gift then an effect of Art, in which he did not want his holy veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, alwayes mannaging ſome paſſages of the ſacred Writ, to which moſt charming part (as well as that of the Sword) he owed moſt of his victories. He was alwayes accuſtomed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort his Souldiers at the undertaking of any great enterprize, or before a Battle: He had a ſtrict eye over his Army, his greateſt care being to ſee them provided of all neceſſaries, by which foreſight he was the better able to execute ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them for their miſdemeanours. He took great delight to diſcourſe of the Affairs of the World, of the intereſts of other Princes, in which his judgement did ſo guide him, that without entering into their Cabinets, or partaking of their ſecret Councels, he could diſcourſe very pertinently of their Affairs, and foreſaw their ſeveral iſſues and events; he was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Phyſiognomer, having once ſeriouſly conſidered any one, he was ſeldom deceived in the opinion he had of him. He was no friend to the vain-gloriouſneſs of habit, and though he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:116025:323"/>as it were fierce, of a paſſionate conſtitution; yet he was ſo ſly, as to keep his paſſions in; but when there was occaſion to carry a buſineſs on, he expoſed himſelf with ſo much vigour, as gave thoſe he had to do withal to underſtand, that he was not eaſily perſwaded from the thing he had once reſolved. He had one knack above all the reſt which ſtood him in much ſtead, he had a deep inſight into the natures and diſpoſitions of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who as they are impatient of ſervitude, ſo are they incapable of intire liberty; frighted with the ſight of the rod, but mutinous in the feeling of it, none talking more of liberty, nor underſtanding it leſs then they; more troubling themſelves then their heads with their grievances, conſidering nothing, but repining at every thing; bold talkers ſo you ſuffer them but to talk: Above all, moſt tenacious of their liberty of Conſcience, rather to follow any new fangled opinion, then to remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the old; his policy herein was to allow them ſomething to induce others to their dear liberty (or licenſe rather) of their tongues, which he knew he could not help, but ſo as that he had his Eves-droppers every where, who ſeldom brought him word of what they ſaid, except they alſo gave an account of what they had, and then their Eſtates paid for the malepertneſs of their tongues, and for their chiefeſt darling of all to erre in their opinions: He permitted them to follow and embrace what Sect they pleaſed, ſo that they all remained in obedience to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government. This was his Method, whileſt mens rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did comprehend ſo little, as that they needed their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to believe how he</hi> (Atlas-<hi>like</hi>) <hi>could ſupport ſo mighty a Frame and Mathin, compoſed of ſo many different and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted parts, yet to keep them from ſlipping and falling in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which he did, rivetting them ſo faſt together, and making them all firmly cohere amongſt themſelves, as ſo many pieces of ſoft wax melted and moulded all in one could not cleave fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in a Ball or Globe: this was the great work he had begun, which had not death prevented him, he was on point of finiſhing, as he was a perſon indefatigable both of body and minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="608" facs="tcp:116025:324"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Politicians hold, that in the changing the Government, all things, if it were convenient and poſſible, ought to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; the very Religion it ſelf, if any were prophane enough to meddle with it. To wave their Atheiſtical opinions, this may be obſerved, that both in reſpect of his policy and fortunes, he might very well, having ſo many advantages over the preſent diſtractions of the times, raiſe his thoughts to more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ambitions: It is onely for God to ſearch the heart, and try the Reins, he knows what our religious affections are, we ought to conjecture charitably of what we cannot determine: this we are certain of, he could ſo well ſee through Superſtition (as in theſe times they term it) for his better advantage, as that his political conſcience could diſpence with more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Tranſactions: nevertheleſs he was ſtill under the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Sanctuary, ſome of the Cleargy (as they have ever done) ſtuck cloſe to him, to raiſe him and themſelves; whereas the late King undid himſelf for the then flouriſhing Cleargy, and they themſelves for him. 'Tis true, his actions were comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a military ſoul, ſo that he had the leſs leiſure to diſpute caſes of Conſcience; onely he might with the Emperour, as he did, cite Saint</hi> Paul, The good that I would, I do not; but the evil that I would not, that I do: now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but ſin that remains in me. <hi>The truth is, he made no haſte in the ſettlement of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Affairs, as he was too crafty to diſturb the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful party, thoſe that were unſettled in their opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to his State Employments he took ſeveral Oaths, which for the preſent might ſtand him in ſome ſtead, yet certainly they might have endangered him to much loſs in his after enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, which depended upon faith. In his Youth I have heard he was ſo uncircumſpect, as not to riſe, experience having taught him in his latter time wiſdom to repair himſelf, his better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune miraculouſly making up all his breaches; his Martial ſpirit advancing him in times as it were ſet apart for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, full of mutations and rare accidents; for it is with times
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:116025:324"/>as it is with ways, with ſome they are up hill, and with ſome they are down hill: nor could he have made good his footing, had he not been full of ſuſpitions, of ſecret thoughts, of ſerious obſervations, full of notes and memorials, eſpecially as he was well read in the men of his time; whom to employ, whom to reward, whom to enquire of, whom to beware of; what were the dependancy, what were the factions, as it were keeping a Journal of his thoughts. Indeed one can ſcarcely write that he was too ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, too apprehenſive; though queſtionleſs he was by reaſon of his reſtleſs jealouſies a trouble to himſelf as well as others, ſo that which did him good one way, did him hurt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Although, as hath been already ſaid, his Flies and Familiars were uſeful to him for the diſcovering of Conſpiracies, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing of which no queſtion preſerved him from many dangers from being attempted, his nature being almoſt married to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, his confidence made him ſucceſsful; to go through them; his cunning alwayes winding him out, he being the more ready, and ſharpened by the occaſions of perils; howſoever the daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of his ſuſpitions gave his induſtries enough to do to ſave himſelf and help others. Queſtionleſs he had wiſdom, and a ſtrange kinde of rule and ſtrain of Government, which all men acknowledged in the bittereſt of times. His Armies neither in Civil nor Forreign Wars were ever unfortunate. As his great judgement in leading as well as preſerving them, in courage perſonally fighting with them, determined him to be both a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Souldier, and an expert Commander; which indeared his Souldiers ſo much to him, as that they ſuffered him to act for the future for himſelf what they did not ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Many Battels he fought with them, in all which he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpht, his fortunes being ever inviolable; thus as he appears ſtrangely ſucceſsful to poſterity, ſo likewiſe moſt unhappy for thoſe bloudy Conqueſts he obtained, they being in the bowels of his own Countrey. He ſignalized the magnanimity of his minde by putting his Souldiers on miraculous attempts, as well
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:116025:325"/>in the Chriſtian as the other Heathen parts of the world; the queſtion is, ſo much honourable blood being ſhed in his time, whether future Hiſtories will waſh his memory clean from it, though malice it ſelf cannot charge him that he was actually nocent, yet poſterity will hardly believe but that he was in ſome degree guilty. But to come cloſer to him, of thoſe three things which either ſhould or ought to tye the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to thoſe that govern,</hi> Love, Fear, <hi>and</hi> Reverence; <hi>he onely purchaſt of them chiefly to himſelf</hi> Fear, <hi>which is furtheſt from the heart; which forced him, being ſometimes ſtraitned in his Affairs, to retire much to his Cabinet Councel, with whom he ſat often in perſon, where he was alwayes fair ſpoken, not without his ſweetneſſes and blandiſhments of words; but his Rhetorick was not ſo vainly ſpent, but that before he went he informed his Judgement; and though thoſe were cunning that he employed, yet he had ſtill a Reſerve to himſelf, as he had the Maſter-reach; ſuch an extent his Judgement had, though it was not much aſſiſted by his former learning, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by his future ſtudies; the Trumpet and Drum ſounding ſo loud in his ears, that he had little leaſure to admit of the ſober Councels of Philoſophy. He was nevertheleſs well enough furniſht, as his wit had long before purchaſed</hi> Lewis <hi>the Eleventh's ſo well known ſlights, which he left to his Son as Maximes for his practice, as one in another caſe writes of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, that they ſhould be kept till the breath ſtinks. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs his diſſimulation in tranſactings, together with his privacy and ſilence in his mannagements were to him aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beyond all Arts and Sciences. In his time there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſuffered, the more bloud was drawn; the leſs love he found, the leſs Treaſure, which with a good will he never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. One writes, that he diſtributed forty thouſand pounds a year in charitable uſes out of his own purſe; he might have been more plain in his expreſſions, certainly he meant out of the Commonwealths Moneys. We may conclude thus much, that his annual incomes were not ſo great as malice hath given out,
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:116025:325"/>conſidering all his neceſſary expences; without diſpute they had been more enlarged, if the people had loved him but half ſo well as they fear'd him, though I muſt ſtill acknowledge it to be hard to diſtinguiſh of his liberality, his neceſſities having ſo much limited his rewards; though his minde was high, and he purſued his own way as one that always revered his own will. If we look on his careful or rather politick liberality, ſomewhat may be ſaid, as he was at vaſte charges, as he made good his dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to impropriate himſelf with Forreign Inſtruments to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good intelligence from all parts abroad; from which ſpies all wiſe men conclude, that he received more Articles of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition then Negotiation, as he was ſtill working and caſting up others, not to be undermined himſelf. Some are ſo humbly minded as to believe his deſigns were too high for forreign parts, certain it is</hi> Carolus Guſtavus <hi>loſt a dear friend of him; and for other Princes howſoever they might look a ſquint on him, he was courted by two of the greateſt, and was a friend (as if fortune attended him) to either of them both when he pleaſed, they having as much as they could allyed themſelves to his Intereſts, when they once found him to be at leaſure to be helpful to them. 'Tis true for ſome time they ſtood at a diſtance, certainly if they did not ſo ſoon ſee into the paſſages of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, they did at laſt paſs their Judgements on the iſſue of them; perhaps they at the firſt ſaw him onely at ſtrife, but they were afterwards forced to acknowledge him to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aloft, ſo fortunate he was in all his enterprizes. The Royal Party were once of opinion, that he having paſt his Laurels, he had a minde to reach at the Crown; they were ſomewhat mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, it had too many thorns in it, which of themſelves are ſharp enough to fetch blood, if we ſhould not otherwiſe accept of the interpretation of the Fifth Monarchy Gentleman, who means by them the diſpleaſed Souldiery, to whom ſuch luſtres could never have been acceptable, as ſome other of our late Pamphletters have libell'd him to be another</hi> Henry <hi>the Fifth; that he would have ſtoln the more then proteſted againſt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:116025:326"/>off from the Pillow; if he had a minde to it, it is more then they know, the worſt they could have ſaid of him had been, that he entertained ſomewhat more then ſelf-denying thoughts, or rather as the Poet hath it,</hi> Magnis tamen excedit auſis. <hi>Indeed outwardly he ſeemed to have little of vain glory in him, or elſe he turned his dark Lanthorn to himſelf, his cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being alwayes ſuch, that this great Politician walkt invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; others ſtood in the light to him, but he in the dark to all, onely for his moſt grand Tranſaction there was no vizzard could diſguiſe it, that he ſhould after ſo many ſelfiſh refuſals, (a word lately put into the new canting Dictionary of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts) that he ſhould after the ſlighting as it were of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tendred, forfeited, and ſequeſtred Eſtates preſented to him by the Parliament for his remarkable ſervices; after that in parts and piecemeals he had denied the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, he made it his maſter-deſign to take in all at once, as he knew well enough how to cog a die, he had thrown for all, won all, and ſwept all at once; rendering his Motto,</hi> Pax quaeritur Bello, <hi>into that Engliſh which pleaſed him beſt, the Protectorſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To reflect briefly on his Domeſtical Affairs, he was not ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orious, but reſpectful to his Wife, to his Children he had a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection, careful of their educations, and of their aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to advancement; he endeavoured to caſt a luſtre on them, which did not take with the people, though as to his Son <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> there was a more then ordinary conſent. For his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures there is no extraordinary news of them, ſome Frolicks I have heard of, with thoſe he was moſt familiar, the truth is, he had too little leaſure for trivial repaſts; he did with them as great perſons do with Banquets, come and look upon them, and ſo turn away. As he begun from a private fortune, as I have already intimated, that fortune quickened in him all ſeeds of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, being alwayes more proſperous in himſelf, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the affections of others. For the imputations againſt him of moneys in his Treaſury, certainly if he had been ſuch
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:116025:326"/>a hoarder, the urgency of his preſſing Affairs would never ſuffer him to be ſo poor as to ſtand ſtill, and admire his riches. Before I end, I cannot chuſe but remark his hard dealings with Parliaments, which he formerly ſo vindicated againſt the late King for his breach of priviledge about the five Members, whatſoever fine thred he did twiſt for himſelf, in all his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches, thoſe that are right Engliſhmen will never clear him from his violations, though he mannaged thoſe actings as that they were to him but ſhort tempeſts, or ſmall over-caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as whatſoever injury the Nations endured, he had one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or other to ſhift it off from his own ſhoulders, extreamly miſtaking himſelf, as the people look leſs on the failings of thoſe who have been their own choice, then on thoſe who have taken on them to be earvers for themſelves; he thought himſelf crafty enough for Parliaments, and from his death-bed he determined himſelf cock ſure, as he was fleſht with his former fortunes; he could never have imagined his poſterity ſhould ever have been lean. 'Tis true, we may be ſo political, as on this earth to endeavour to graſp theſe humane Affairs to our own Intereſts, but we muſt lay down our greateſt wiſedoms when we come to ſleep in the ſilent grave, as after death there is no providing againſt the croſs blows of fortune.</hi>

                  <hi>To conclude, as far as we can conjecture, his Confederates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing alike victorious, and fortunate with him, he might if he had lived to it, extended his victories to ſome other parts of the world; if he did no more, it was either through the diſturbances of the times, or long of himſelf, for what he minded he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. Certain it is, that he ſo husbanded his ſucceſſes, that he did not live to ſee himſelf unfortunate, who having aſſumed or rather ſnatcht his honours, ſhewed himſelf to be one of the ſtrangeſt ſort of wonders that our late times have produced. One writ a ſtrange Epitaph on him,</hi> Here lies <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> who that he might be Protector himſelf, firſt brought the Engliſh Monarchy on its knees.</p>
